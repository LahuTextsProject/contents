65 Visiting the Village's Fields

\. Headman: \texttt{<}clears throat\texttt{>} ``This morning we're going to visit
the fields, right? Are the two of you \footnote{Cà-lɔ̂ and the author} going along? Cà-lɔ̂?

\. Cà-lɔ̂: We'll go!

\. H: OK. Well, you're going to take pictures of all the things connected with
our cultivating our \{swiddens/ mountain fields\}, aren't you?

\. C: Yes, fine!

\. H: Let's go then, right now. You have \{the/ enough\} time to go, right?

\. C: Go! Say, on the road you're \{going on/ taking\} are there many Northern
Thai \footnote{The Lahu make a clear distinction between \textbf{Kɔ́lɔ́} `Northern Thai'} villages?

\. H: There are lots of them. As for Northern Thai, \{there are plenty/ there's
no shortage\} \footnote{\textbf{pə̀-lə̂ʔ} (N) `plenty; abundance' \texttt{<} N. Thai} of them! There are one or two villages.

\. And a road for motor-cars \{reaches/ goes\} almost up to our fields over there.

\. Yeah, this village right here \footnote{\textbf{ kàʔ kàʔ} is colloquial for\textbf{ chò kàʔ} `here'} is Northern Thai.

1\. All of these many trees by the roadside here belong to the ``Big Boss'' \footnote{\textbf{šathê-}(\texttt{<} Bs.) \textbf{ló} ( \texttt{<} Tai): a wealthy}.

1\. And there ahead of us there's another Northern Thai village.

1\. All these tea \{orchards/ plantations\} are also Northern Thai.

1\. Not Central Thai folks...

1\. Yeah, and we have to draw water \footnote{\textbf{ í-kâʔ qho ve} (OV): a very laborious process, filling up gourds}. Right here. To drink in the fields

1\. C: Isn't there any water up there?

1\. H: No, there isn't. We scoop up all the water here that we use everyplace in
the fields...

1\. Hey, how about rolling ourselves a \{cigar/ smoke\}, OK? One for each of us.

1\. C: Yeah, that'd be great.

1\. H: Oh, when you make a cigar to smoke \{out of/ in\} a banana leaf it's very
harsh.

2\. Here, when we make them in corn-husks, they smell great.

2\. Here, you smoke one too!

2\. Just grab those matches over there!

2\. This cigar is hard to light \footnote{\textbf{tú mâ tòʔ  pɨ́}:}! It's a little too wet.

2\. C: Whose tobacco is it?

2\. H: It's the \{Kachin's/ Jingpho's\} \footnote{A Jingpho man was a long-term resident of Huey Tat (prob. came with them \texttt{<}} tobacco! Yep, it must not have been
well dried, this tobacco. You can't light it...

2\. Hey, these tea gardens here we Lahu pick to earn money...\footnote{\textbf{phə̂ʔ câ}:}

2\. Over there what's hanging high up on a tree is a honeycomb.

2\. Have you ever \{tasted/ licked\} the juice \footnote{\textbf{ɔ̀-g̈ɨ̀} `liquid', here used instead of \textbf{pɛ̂-g̈ɨ̀}?

2\. C: We have tasted \{the juice/ honey\} before.

3\. H: Did it taste very good?

3\. C: Delicious!

3\. H: There are twelve nests hanging there. Now, this year there \{aren't that
many/ are rather few\} of them hanging.

3\. The \{path/ road\} to where we \{scoop up/ draw\} water to drink is up a very
steep slope.

3\.When we carry the water we must go home bending our heads [forward to keep our
balance].

3\. This road here is the road that we usually \{walk on/ take\}.

3\. So it's not far now until we \{get to/ reach\} the fields.

3\. When we get/ reach up there onto the saddleback \footnote{\textbf{qā-lèʔ}: `a relatively flat or low part of a mountain; saddleback;} in the mountains, we'll
be able to see over there where the fields are.

3\. Look over there! Those people tilling the fields, they're our Lahu folks \footnote{\textbf{Lâhū-yâ:} lit. ``Lahu sons; Lahu children.'' cf. Heb. B'nei Yisrael.}.

3\. \texttt{<}shouting to the workers\texttt{>} Till the fields well, till `em
well now!

4\. We'll take a picture of your backs!

4\. Field-worker: What are you looking for?

4\. We're just visiting. Well, you're tilling the field. Don't exert yourselves
so much!

4\. If you don't have anything to eat and drink you'll have no strength.

4\. Really tasty food---pork, chicken \footnote{H. is gently teasing them. Meat was something eaten only on special occasions,}.

4\. Prepare the food properly and \textit{then} work.

4\. You'll have the strength.

4\. If you don't have \{food/ curries\} \footnote{\textbf{ɔ̄-chî}: lit. ``rice-lifter'' (\textbf{chî }`lift up'), that which} to eat you'll have no strength---when
you're working in the fields.

4\. \{If/ When\} you should hook [your tool] onto a tree stump you could topple
over backwards!

4\. Cook delicious curries to eat [before working]. \footnote{`Before working' conveyed by the Pv \textbf{šē }`inchoative'}

5\. There's an awful lot of hard work [to do] around here.

5\. If you guys drop dead, [your hard work] can't follow you [to the grave]. Take
it easy!

...

5\. H: Whew, the sun sure is hot!

5\. And the dust stinks so bad you could die. \footnote{\textbf{šɨ e la yò}: cf. the Thai intensifier \textbf{cə taaj}.}

5\. Today our whole bodies will all get pitch-black with dirt. \footnote{This sentence contains two words meaning `all,' each with a slightly different}

5\. Wow, the sun is so hot!

5\. Hey, guys, why don't we just go hunting for something to eat!

5\. Say, would the two of you like to go?

5\. Cà-lɔ̂: We'd love to!

5\. H: Well, let's go see to the guns first. If there's one gun per person \footnote{\textbf{tê g̈â tê qhɔ̂}:\textbf{ g̈â} `Clf for people', \textbf{qhɔ̂}}
we can go.

6\. C: Hurry and look for them. Two of them.

6\. H: There's a guy over there. I don't know whether or not he's going along.

6\. C: If it's him, I hear he's never shot a gun in his life. \footnote{Lit. ``I hear he's never shot---as for the thing called a gun.''}

6\. H: Well, let's go see then. Cà-qā, please go and ask your father. Your father's
probably not going [hunting with us].

6\. Cà-qā: Oh, he actually left yesterday. All by himself he's lying in wait
up there in the mountains, up on a rocky slope!

6\. H: I guess he's gone then, \{he also/ him too\}.

6\. So, let's take some pictures now.

6\. Let's take a picture of all of us shooting guns, carrying guns on our shoulders,
aiming our guns \{at treetops/ high at the trees\}.

6\. Cà-lɔ̂: What kinds of guns are they?

6\. H: They're flintlocks! \footnote{\textbf{\emph{màʔ-tɛ̂ʔ}}\textbf{-nâʔ}: a muzzle-loading gun whose fuse} They're big muskets. \footnote{\textbf{lɔ̂-kà-tù}: more or less synonymous with \textbf{màʔ-tɛ̂ʔ-nâʔ}.}

7\. Somebody: that'll be OK, I guess.

7\. H: They're very fine. They're Pie-talian! \footnote{\textbf{pítalêiʔ}: evidently a garbled version of `Italian'-cf. Thai \textbf{ʔiitaalii}.} They're called Pie-talian.

7\. Cà-lɔ̂: What does ``Pie-talian'' mean?

7\. H: ``Pie-talian'' means šÁn-phɔ̀ʔ \footnote{I have been unable to trace this word, which might well be a jocular invention}---it's šÁn-phɔ̀ʔ!

7\. Cà-lɔ̂: Well, what does šÁn-phɔ̀ʔ mean then?

7\. H: It means Pie-talian, I told you. šÁn-phɔ̀ʔ.

7\. Cà-g̈âʔ: Where do they say that the Pietalian guns came from?

7\. H: A long time ago they came from a white man's country.

7\. Cà-g̈âʔ: Which white man's country?

7\. H: A white man's country down there in the west, in the southern part.

8\. Cà-g̈âʔ: A place where black people live?

8\. H: White people, a white person's country. White people.

8\. Cà-g̈âʔ: I bet they're not white, they're probably black.

8\. The black people's country is still to the south. \texttt{<}changing the subject\texttt{>}

8\. Well, let's take some pictures, one person in each picture, carrying guns on
our shoulders, on our backs \footnote{\textbf{tâʔ}: `carry on shoulder'; \textbf{pû }`carry on the back'.}---all of us.

8\. Oh boy, today the sun is so hot! We went hunting---we're exhausted.

8\. Woman: You men go hunting, we women catch frogs.

8\. I didn't get to shoot a single animal. Nobody drove any animals towards me.

8\. Down below me where you were you should have followed the animals' trail properly.
There were plenty \footnote{\textbf{cí-cí mâ hêʔ}: a pleonastic expression, lit. ``not just a little} of barking-deer tracks.

8\. You guys drove the animals \textit{away}. \footnote{I.e., instead of towards me.} They went down from the mountain
peak over there.

9\. If you had only shouted and driven them over there towards me on the high ground
above the river, I would have caught a barking-deer!

\texttt{<}unintelligible passage\texttt{>}

9\. The barking-deer are still over there. Under the rocks.

9\. Woman: Your wife and children are waiting for something to eat at home.

9\. H: Oh, those damn barking-deer! They don't show themselves where people are.

9\. Since you guys drove [the game] that way for me, today we just went wandering
around wasting time.

9\. Very soon now we'll go hunting together properly in the jungle.

9\. Woman: That's the way it is! We're not going to get anything to eat. \footnote{From the hunting of you men.} If
we [women] go catch some frogs we'll have something to eat.

9\. H: Well, there's an old proverb [about this]. You're wrong. ``Think not that
ye shall always fail, nor suppose that ye shall always succeed.'' Don't think you
won't ever get anything to eat, whether you get anything or not [on any specific
occasion].

9\. Never get weary of \{going/ making forays\} into the jungle---think ``I'll
catch something to eat,'' and go look for it!
