27 In Unity there is Strength 3/9/65

Sermon by Pastor CÃ bo

\. Once upon a time there was an old man among us Lahu.

\. His sons were seven in number.

\. So for those seven sons of his, they couldn't get along with each other at all,
and were always just quarreling and bickering among themselves.

\. Even when the father would [try to] \{teach them/ give them advice\}, they would
not heed their father's words.

5a. One day the father said to them, ``Oh, my seven sons! []

5b. ``Each one of you go get a stick and bring it to Father,'' he said.

\. When they got them they gave them to their father.

\. Their father tied up the sticks together, and first had the eldest son bend
them.

\. Then he made the second son bend them.

\. Then he had the third son bend them.

1\. Then he had the fourth one bend them.

1\. Then he had the fifth one bend them.

1\. Until the seventh one, one after the other he had them bend them.

1\. [But] since he hid these sticks together, they could not break them by bending
them.

1\. The father said to all his sons, ``Oh, my sons! If people love and cherish
each other it is just like this.

1\. Whether it be robbers and bandits, whether it's any kind of thing that can
destroy you, they can't destroy a single one of you,'' he said.

1\. Then the father untied and separated the sticks, and gave each person one stick.

1\. When he had given each of them a stick, and again had them bend them, every
stick broke.

1\. The father instructed them and said, ``Oh, seven sons of mine, if you separate
and disperse, if you don't get along harmoniously, and if you don't respect one
another, if you each go your own way, it will be just like this.

1\. If things that can destroy you should befall you, others can always help you,''
he said, instructing his sons.

2\. For this reason, if all of us Lahu of today's generation take this story to
heart, it would be good.
