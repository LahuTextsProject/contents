107c Fit to be Tied

1 There were two men.

2 The two of them were going together along a road.

3 [The Yellow Lahu] said to the Black Lahu, ``When we get up there on the mountain,
let's roll ourselves some tobacco [and smoke] for a while''.\footnote{Literally, `let's put in a roll [crumple] tobacco for a while'.}

4 Then, when they got up there, the Black Lahu said, ``Okay, I'll just roll up
my pants, and ---``.

5 ``What the hell are you doing? he asked, so he answered, ``Didn't you just say
you were going to \{roll/tie\} us up?''
