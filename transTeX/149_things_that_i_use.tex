\footnote{This text has been edited from Red Lahu.}1 As for the things which I have used:

a yoke for pigs, a big axe, a square hoe,

a mattock, a towel, a small chisel,

a basket, a saw, a winnowing tray,

a shoulder bag, a turban, a shirt, a pair of trousers, a belt, a pair of leggings,
a pair of socks, a pair of shoes.

Things like this are what I have had.
