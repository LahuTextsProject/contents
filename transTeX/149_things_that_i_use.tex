1 As for the things which I have used: a yoke for pigs, a big axe, a square hoe,
a mattock, a small chisel, a basket, a saw, a winnowing tray, a shoulder bag, a
turban, a shirt, a pair of trousers, a belt, a pair of leggings, a pair of socks,
a pair of shoes --- things like this are what I have had.
