1. Once upon a time there were two people.\footnote{The quotative particle \textbf{cê} is left untranslated, since this story-teller uses it in virtually every sentence.}

2. One of them was an expert laundryman. The other was an expert potter.

3. One day, when they were comparing their wealth, [the potter thought] he didn't
earn as much as the laundryman, money-wise.\footnote{This last word is meant to carry the afterthought-like postposing of the object \textbf{phu} `money, wealth'.}

4. This potter thought that the laundryman was trying to ruin him.

5. [So] he got an idea about a certain jet-black elephant that the local prince
\footnote{A \textbf{cāw-fā} (< Shan \textit{caaw phaʔ} [cf. Si. \textit{câaw fáa}]) was a Shan ``prince'' or ``sawbwa'', of whom there were many in the Shan states.} had.

6. The master potter knew in his heart that if the laundryman were to wash that
elephant\footnote{Instead of \textbf{hɔ} `elephant', the story-teller here says \textbf{nô} \textbf{ve} `the one up there', perhaps out of respect for the \textit{sawbwa} whose possession it was. More details on the extent of the sawbwas' domains may be found in Wikipedia.} and it didn't turn white, he [the laundryman] would lose his livelihood,
so he went [to the prince] and said:

7. ``My lord, O prince, if you would only wash the elephant white, when people
would see it they'd say, `This is amazing!''

8. So then the Prince said, ``Who is there who can wash this elephant of mine white?''

9. When he asked this, the potter said, ``A certain expert laundryman can wash
it white.

10. In fact he has a lot of money, more than me, more than me the master potter!''

11. ``If you summon that fellow\footnote{\textbf{nô} \textbf{ve} \textbf{phâ} `the fellow up there'.} and make him wash it, I believe it will really
turn white,'' he said.

12. When he said this, the lord prince said, ``Mûlò, go and summon here that
master laundryman!''

13. Then when he had been summoned and came, he [the laundryman] said, ``My method
of washing is that I must have a great big pot made, a huge basin\footnote{\textbf{šá-qhâʔ} usually means `cylindrical rice-steamer' (see DL:1162), but in this context it seems to mean `huge basin (large enough to wash an elephant in)'.}, to wash
in.''

14. When he said this, the prince said to the potter, ``O potter, you call your
assistant(s) and make that pot!''

15. So [they] made the pot and carried it [in]\footnote{The non-3rd person benefactive particle \textbf{lâ} is used instead of \textbf{pî} , apparently to impart greater vividness.}, and they took the elephant's
foot and put it in, and it shattered.

16. After [the elephant] broke it once, broke it twice, broke it three times, the
lord prince said, ``Since you first thought you would ruin another person, now
you have been ruined [yourself].

17. ``Do not earn your living as a potter anymore!

18. ``As for the laundryman, earn your living well by washing!'' he said.

19. That's the end.
