1 Well, now, once there were two men. 2 These two men both went into the jungle,
and \{got / caught\} a monkey--the'd gone monkey-hunting. 3 When they caught the
monkey they went to sell the monkey-meat to a [certain] Shan. 4 The Shan said:
\texttt{"}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}?\texttt{"}
5 That means \texttt{"}Friend, what kind of meat is it?\texttt{"}1

6 Now the two of them didn't know the Shan language at all. 7 So when they were
spoken to, they kept quiet.2 8 They didn't know what to say. 9 \texttt{"}You, you
tell him!\texttt{"} they said (to each other), and they remained silent. 10 Well
the Shan kept asking them \texttt{"}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}?\texttt{"}

11 Finally,3 they said \texttt{"}Meat live in tree, meat live in tree!\texttt{"}4

12 But the Shan didn't understand. 13 He just kept saying \texttt{"}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}?\texttt{"}
[=what kind of meat?] 13 \texttt{"}Meat live in tree\texttt{"} they said.

14 Well, he couldn't understand, he just couldn't, so finally one of the men [jumped
up and] swung from [a beam in] the Shan's house while the other one fixed an arrow
to his bow and aimed it at him.5

15 Whereupon the Shan had to beg them [for mercy]. 16 \texttt{"}Now I understand,
now I understand!\texttt{"} he said.6
