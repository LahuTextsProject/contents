1 Well, now, once there were two men. 2 These two men both went into the jungle,
and \{got / caught\} a monkey--the'd gone monkey-hunting. 3 When they caught the
monkey they went to sell the monkey-meat to a [certain] Shan. 4 The Shan said:
``\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}?``
5 That means ``Friend, what kind of meat is it?``1

6 Now the two of them didn't know the Shan language at all. 7 So when they were
spoken to, they kept quiet.2 8 They didn't know what to say. 9 ``You, you
tell him!`` they said (to each other), and they remained silent. 10 Well
the Shan kept asking them ``\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}?``

11 Finally,3 they said ``Meat live in tree, meat live in tree!``4

12 But the Shan didn't understand. 13 He just kept saying ``\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}?``
[=what kind of meat?] 13 ``Meat live in tree`` they said.

14 Well, he couldn't understand, he just couldn't, so finally one of the men [jumped
up and] swung from [a beam in] the Shan's house while the other one fixed an arrow
to his bow and aimed it at him.5

15 Whereupon the Shan had to beg them [for mercy]. 16 ``Now I understand,
now I understand!`` he said.6
