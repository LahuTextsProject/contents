26 Calling back a wandering soul

[Recited by an elderly gentleman on March 9, 1965, in a sort of Akha-Lahu hybrid.
The syntax and lexicon of Akha and Lahu are quite similar, so that Lahu equivalents
of the Akha morphemes may simply be substituted for them, creating a grammatical
Lahu text.

The text will be given first the way the speaker recited it. Some of the words
are pure Akha and are so labelled. They are normalized into a transcription developed
by Paul Lewis. The text will then be given in an all-Lahu version.]

1 Come back!

2 Do not \{stay/tarry\} among the \{hills/mountains\} and valleys!\footnote{i.e., in the wilderness.}

3 If you tarry in the \{hills/mountains\} and valleys, you will not even have liquor
to drink, not get to drink even a little bit, and you won't have rice to eat.

4 Do not tarry in the hills.

5 Come back!

6 Return to your father and your mother!\footnote{The body is considered to be the parents of the soul.}

7 Do not go anywhere else.

8 If you go off somewhere, you won't have anything to eat afterwards.

9 You won't even get to eat meat again.

10 Return to your father and mother!

11 Come back, come back!

12 [Otherwise] you'll get nothing to eat again.

13 Return to your father and mother!

14 Come back, come back!

15 You'll get nothing to eat again.
