Lexicon}}}{\LARGE{}\textbf{ (pp. 449-450), and JAM 2011c).}}

{\LARGE{}Speaker A:}

{\LARGE{}1. OK, come on [1] ---once upon a time sweet peppers---whoops! [2]---hot
peppers, sweet sugar-cane, there are these two kinds of things.}

{\LARGE{}2. That is, sugar-cane on the one hand is very sweet.}

{\LARGE{}3. Peppers, on the other hand, are very hot.}

{\LARGE{}4. So, as they say [3], ``People don't die under pepper-bushes; they die
under clumps of sugar-cane.'' [4]}

{\LARGE{}5. Then they say, ``Dry branches make good tinder; the young make good
servants [5] for their elders.''}

{\LARGE{}6. When you say, ``If you don't know what you're doing, don't go into
an abandoned old field, [6]'' it means that bears     }

{\LARGE{}might come and bite you.}

{\LARGE{}7. When you say ``Don't knock out [the ashes from] a clay pipe on a stone,''
it means a piece might break off. [7]}

{\LARGE{}8. ``A fair maid should not sit next to a youth; a fair youth should not
sit next to a maid'', they say.}

{\LARGE{}Speaker B (correcting him):}

{\LARGE{}9. You mean ``should not sit next to a }{\LARGE{}\textit{bear}}{\LARGE{}!''
