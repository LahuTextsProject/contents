90 Proverbs (see JAM 2011c)

\. OK, come on---once upon a time sweet peppers---whoops!\footnote{The speaker starts out as if he's going to tell a story, then catches himself}---hot peppers, sweet
sugar-came, there are these two kinds of things.

\. That is, sugar-cane on the one hand is very sweet.

\. Peppers, on the other hand, are very hot.

\. So, as they say \footnote{``As they say'' translates the quotative Pnf cê}, ``People don't die under pepper-bushes; they die under
clumps of sugar-cane.''\footnote{I.e., misfortune often strikes when one is least expecting it.}

\. Then they say, ``Dry branches are food for the fire; young folks are servants
for their elders.''

OR

\. ``Dry branches make good tinder; the young make good servants for their elders.''

\. When you say, ``If you don't know what you're doing, don't go into an \{abandoned\}
old field, \footnote{hɛ-šā: an old field now overgrown, where animals are likely to hang out.}'' it means that bears might come and bite you.

\. When you say ``Don't knock out [the ashes from] a clay pipe on a stone,'' it
means a piece might break off. \footnote{Cf. Eng. ``Don't build a fire in a wooden stove.''}

\. ``A fair maid should not \{sit next to/ consort with\} a youth; a fair youth
should not consort with a maid'', they say.

1\. [Correcting him] You mean ``[a fair youth] should not consort with \textit{bears}!''
