Courting Badinage

14 Thû-yì: Well, Khumaw, where would you like to go anyway?

15 K-m: I've come to visit.

16 T-y: Aren't you planning to go visit over \textit{there} now?\footnote{I.e., `wouldn't you rather go find some girls?'}

17 K-m: No, I came to visit \textit{here}.

18 T-y: Pa-eh, what about you?

19 H: He's probably going to go around visiting on a day like today, Sunday. There's
no sense in just hanging around.\footnote{\textit{gɨ̂ chɛ̂} (V\_h+V\_v) 'be doing for pleasure, be fooling around' vs. \textit{ca gɨ̂ tô} (v\_V + V\_h + V\_v) 'go around for pleasure, go on a round of visits.'} You shouldn't\footnote{Clause + \textit{(m)â hêʔ o} `one shouldn't Clause.' Lit. ``it is not (a case of) clause.''} just lie around blinking your
eyes sleepily! You're just wasting time!

20 K-m: We'll go court the girls over there.

21 H: So you're going courting, huh?

22 K-m: Don't you guys want to go?

23 T-y: Where to?

24 K-m: Over there--you know.

25 T-y: Over there, at Me-jwe, like you said!

26 H: Up there around Ven-pa-may, up there under a big banyan tree there's a little
place where they do it! Don't you know the way [to get there]?

27 T-y: I'm definitely going to go!

28 Pà-ɛ́: We have three or four people [who want to go]!

29 H: Get together and go, get together and go, you young fellows. When I was your
age\footnote{Lit. ''when I was like you.''} I used to go, all right!

30 Kachin: You should please cut me in on the deal!\footnote{The Kachin is an older man, something of a clown. He was still single, since Lahu girls hesitate to marry members of different tribes. Lit: ''Please share together with me.''}

<Laughter. Everybody talks at once.>

31 H: How many are there, did you say? How many girls?\footnote{Less colloquially: \textit{yâ-mî-hÁ qhà-nî g̈â cɔ̀ le qôʔ ve}.}

32 Pà-ɛ́: There are four or five of them.

33 H: Four or five?

34 Pà-ɛ́: Yes.

35 T-y: How many good-looking ones are there?

36 Pà-ɛ́: They're all good-looking.

37 T-y: There's one who isn't so bad as the others anyway!\footnote{\textit{khɛ̂ ve} < Shan \textit{khɛn} `superior': `to be the best of a poor lot, to be comparatively good.'}

38 Pà-ɛ́: There is one---she's a little better than the others.

39 T-y: That's the one! The one for me!

40       : No, no, no! ... She's mine!

41       : Like hell she's yours\footnote{\textit{thôo khɔ̂} + X: ``what nonsense to say X!'' \textit{thôo} ꞊ \textit{pòthôo} (Interj.), \textit{khɔ̂} `words.'}!

42 Pà-ɛ́: She's mine. I'll give you guys the second-rate\footnote{\textit{ɔ̀-hɔ́} `that which is below; something inferior.'} ones.

43 T-y: Well, in that case I'm not going---I won't go.

44 H: I'll divide them up for you, I'll divide them up for you. As for Number One,\footnote{The headman uses Thai numbers for the rankings, for comic effect.}
she'll be for this gentleman. Number Two is for that guy, and this guy gets Number
Three.

45 T-y: Hey, that's no good, Number One is mine!

46 H: Oh, you can't act that way!

47 Càbo: Good grief, you have no sense of shame\footnote{Lit. ``you don't even know the way of shame.''}!

48 Number One is mine!

49 T-y: Well, don't fight about it like that!

50 Pà-ɛ́: The one who is Number One is mine, I tell you! She's not yours.

51 T-y: You guys are friends, and there you are fighting! You're sure not acting
like friends.

52 Pà-ɛ́: We're laying conflicting claims to a girl, see?\footnote{\textit{vɛ dàʔ ve }(V+Pv): `to vie; dispute a claim with one another.'}

53 Càbo: He says they're each claiming the same girl.

54 Kachin: Well, if you people don't want her, why don't you parcel her out to
me!

55 T-y: She's tiny, why don't you tell him! That ``Number One'' of his.

56 Pà-ɛ́: Yes, Number One certainly\textit{ is} mine.

57 T-y: Let's take her---if only we succeed in courting her.

58 H: Well, so this Number One is a tiny one, is she!

59 Pà-ɛ́: You guys are impossible, just impossible! We can't go on arguing this
way.

60 Càbo: Are you going to have a fight?

61 Pà-ɛ́: We'll have a fight.

62 Càbo: Who was the first one to see that girl?

63 Pà-ɛ́: I saw her first.

64 T-y: After he saw her he said he'd give her to me if I wanted her! Right there
on the road [was where he said that]!

65 Càbo: Then whoever saw her first, that fellow gets the good-looking one. As
for the inferior ones, the ugly ones, we'll give them all to the Little Red Savage\footnote{\textit{Cà-qu-ní} ``The Red Naked One.'' This is Thû-yì's nickname.}
here!

<Laughter>

66 Pà-ɛ́: The Kachin said he'd take one like that.

67 T-y: Well, whoever wants that kind can have them.\footnote{``If it's that kind, whoever wants to get them, gets them.''} Pà-ɛ́, let's you and
me go visiting someplace else! It's not as if there were no other fish in the sea,\footnote{Lit: ''because it is not the case that there are [girls] only in this one place here.''}
you know. Otherwise,\footnote{I.e., if there were no girls anywhere else.} no matter how nicely we discussed it, we'd have to come
to blows, friends that we all are.

68 Pà-ɛ́: There are some over around PÁ-ló and PÁ-màʔ.

69 H: There are millions of them, I bet, when it comes to that.

70 Pà-ɛ́: Plenty of 'em, plenty of 'em.

71 H: Oh, so you're very well informed, are you?\footnote{``Do you know very well?''}

72 Pà-ɛ́: I know whereof I speak!\footnote{``I really know!''}

72b       : I'll bet they're probably not very good-hearted.

73 Kachin: I know a thing about it too.

74 Pà-ɛ́: Since there are pretty ones \textit{and} ugly ones---

75 Càbo: Well, if you observe how a female\footnote{\textit{ɔ̀-sɛ̄-ma}, lit. `a female body.'} does her work, and her behavior\footnote{<\textit{tâ-hêʔ-tâ-càʔ}> < Shan; \textit{càʔ} ult < Bs.},
then you'll know!---whether she has a \textit{kood}\footnote{Càbo says \textit{tàʔ} instead of \textit{dàʔ} `good', imitating the Kachin's tendency to devoice Lahu stops.} character or not.

76 H: Look carefully [for a wife], my boys! It's not as if [you were buying] a
basket or something, you know. You don't get one today and throw it away tomorrow!\footnote{\textit{hə̂ʔ} means both 'get' and 'marry.' \textit{bà} means both 'throw away' and `divorce.'}

77 Pà-ɛ́: They \textit{are} like baskets!

78 H: According to the wise old saying, [a wife] is the ``flower of the hearth
and home.''

78a Càbo: If you want to split up from somebody like that, it's your responsibility!

79 H: You're not buying a naked rabid dog, so if you don't choose carefully, you're
liable to get tired of being married to her. So watch your step!

79a: If you want to break up after you're married just go ahead and marry someone
like that.

80 Pà-ɛ́: If she doesn't have a good character then she's an old basket. If
she does have a good character, she's not a basket.

81 H: Hm, well, then, why don't you fellows stop this business now. Let me tell
you a story. Just listen. How about it?

82    : O.K.
