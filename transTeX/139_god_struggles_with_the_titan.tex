{\LARGE{}139 }{\LARGE{}\textbf{God Struggles with the Titan}}

{\LARGE{}1. I'd like to tell you brethren now about how long, long ago God [1]
created mankind and created everything else.}

{\LARGE{}2. Please listen carefully.}

{\LARGE{}3. Long, long ago when g̈ɨ̀-ša created mankind, he rubbed off the
caked-on dirt from his  feet and his hands, and created human beings [with it],
it is said.}

{\LARGE{}4. After he had finished creating all the humans, he took a left-over
lump and made a giant out of it, and so Cà-mû-cà(-qa)-pɛ [2] came into being.
}

{\LARGE{}5. Then g̈ɨ̀-ša said to all the human beings, ``When your crops are
ripe, all of you must offer to me the first-fruits,'' so since g̈ɨ̀-ša had
said this to the humans, when the crops were ripe they went and offered [the first-fruits]
to g̈ɨ̀-ša.}

{\LARGE{}6. At a point on the road that the humans were traveling, the Titan cà-mû-cà-pɛ
saw them, and asked ``Where are you all going?'', and the people said ``We're going
to make offerings to g̈ɨ̀-ša, our first fruits,'' so the Titan said, ``Make
the offerings to }{\LARGE{}\textit{me}}{\LARGE{}! What kind of God is there? It's
me, I am g̈ɨ̀-ša,'' he said, scolding the humans.}

{\LARGE{}7. }{\LARGE{}\textit{[Addendum]}}{\LARGE{} These people were very afraid
of the giant, so even though they didn't want to make offerings to him, they offered
everything to him and went back home.}

{\LARGE{}8. So then one day, since g̈ɨ̀-ša didn't see any humans coming, he
went to check things out, and when he met the Titan, cà-mû-cà-pɛ said to him,
``What have you come looking for?''}

{\LARGE{}9, So g̈ɨ̀-ša said to the Titan, ``I've been thinking about how the
human beings are doing with their cultivation, so I've come to check it out,''
and cà-mû-cà-pɛ said:}

{\LARGE{}10. ``If you are really God, let's just have a contest and go at each
other to see,'' he said, and they [decided to] have a race [3] to pluck a certain
flower growing on a tree in front of them.}

{\LARGE{}11. So when they raced with all their might [4], when they went racing,
g̈ɨ̀-ša clung to the Titan's leg, and having arrived at the flower on the tree,
g̈ɨ̀-ša managed to pluck it.}

{\LARGE{}12. Therefore he did not prevail over g̈ɨ̀-ša.}

{\LARGE{}13. For the second time the Titan said, ``If you are really God let's
now play hide-and-seek,'' so g̈ɨ̀-ša made the Titan go and hide first.}

{\LARGE{}14. But wherever he went to hide, g̈ɨ̀-ša found him.}

{\LARGE{}15. So then, this time it was g̈ɨ̀-ša's turn to go and hide.}

{\LARGE{}16. But when he went to look for g̈ɨ̀-ša, he couldn't find him.}

{\LARGE{}17. So because he  vigorously searched for him all over this country,
that's why we still have these mountains and valleys, so our ancestors have said.[6]}

{\LARGE{}18. Then, when the time was up, since he couldn't find him, g̈ɨ̀-ša
said ``I've come down!'', and he jumped down right before his eyes.}

{\LARGE{}19. Even though he [g̈ɨ̀-ša] said this, the Titan, since he was very
proud, was still not satisfied, and when g̈ɨ̀-ša created seven suns, he put
seven iron helmets on his head.[7]}

{\LARGE{}20. So g̈ɨ̀-ša soon gave him another punishment.}

{\LARGE{}21. g̈ɨ̀-ša extinguished the suns, [8] so he [the Titan] made a notch
in a pitch-pine tree [9], tied it to a buffalo born and set it on fire, so he could
plow his field.}

{\LARGE{}22. For this reason, to this very day buffalo horns have ridges on them.}

{\LARGE{}23. And, in another place--- [Hesitates]}

{\LARGE{}24. Cà-lɔ̂ <prompting him> What about the dancing
horses?[10]}

{\LARGE{}25. So then, because g̈ɨ̀-ša was angry, he made a dung-beetle and
smeared poison on its horns, and made it go to where the Titan lived\}.}

{\LARGE{}26. When the dung-beetle arrived in the presence of the Titan, the Titan
asked him, ``Where are you going to?'', and the dung-beetle replied, ``Oh, I'm
going to the Jewel City.''}

{\LARGE{}27. ``I've never been to the Jewel City myself.}

{\LARGE{}28. ``Such a tiny thing like you, how could you get there?'' he
said, and he slapped it hard, so that the dung-beetle's horn pricked his hand.}

{\LARGE{}29. So it hurt him a lot and he got mad, and so he gave it a kick with
his foot too![11]}

{\LARGE{}30. So then his foot also swelled way up on him, and his hand also swelled
way up on him, and it hurt terribly, and this time he couldn't stand it any more.}

{\LARGE{}31. So then he went to where g̈ɨ̀-ša was, and begged and besought
him, ``Please cure me with some medicine!'' he said, and g̈ɨ̀-ša said, ``I
have a medicine.''}

{\LARGE{}32. ``So when the medicine is put on, don't unwrap [the bandage]
for seven days.}

{\LARGE{}33. ``Soon after the medicine has been applied, your flesh will
get all tingly as it heals.[12]}

{\LARGE{}34. ``That's just the way it's likely to be,'' he said, he said
to him.}

{\LARGE{}35. So then g̈ɨ̀-ša took seven basketsful [13] of blowfly eggs, and
put them on the Titan's foot and hand, and tied them up nice and tight for him.[14]}

{\LARGE{}36. For seven days,  Cà-mû-cà-pɛ patiently suffered, no matter how
much it hurt [15] him, and when the seventh day came and he opened up [the bandages]
to have a look, all that flesh had rotted away since the maggots had eaten it all
up, so he died.}

{\LARGE{}37. So when he died, g̈ɨ̀-ša called together all the human beings
and all the animals, thinking he would have them bury him.}

{\LARGE{}38. But the humans couldn't manage to bury him. since he was so huge,
so g̈ɨ̀-ša said to them,}

{\LARGE{}38a. ``Make a big cannon, and put what's left of his body into a grindstone
