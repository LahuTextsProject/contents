in a stream, when a crab pinched the grandchild and held on tightly.

2a. So the grandchild said, ``Granny! Please take it off [of me]!'',

2b. and the grandmother said, ``Run, run, [2] granny will let a smelly fart!''
and then when she let fly with a smelly fart, the crab \{latched onto/pinched and
hung onto\} her cunt.

\. So then the grandmother said to her grandchild, ``Please bite into it and break
it, my child!'', but the kid said, ``Oh, it stinks \{too/so\} bad, Granny!''
