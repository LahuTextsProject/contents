1. Once upon a time, a grandmother and her grandchild\footnote{It is not specified whether the grandchild was a girl or a boy, but it was undoubtedly a girl, since damming streams to catch fish or crustaceans was a female activity.} had gone to dam a fork
in a stream, when a crab pinched the grandchild and held on tightly.

2. So the grandchild said, ``Granny! Please take it off [of me]!'', and the grandmother
said, ``Run, run, granny will let a smelly fart!''\footnote{Presumably the grandmother meant that her granddaughter should prepare to run away with the crab dangling from her, while the grandmother would distract the crab by breaking wind so dramatically that it would let go.} and then when she let fly
with a smelly fart\footnote{The expression \textbf{qhɛ̂} \textbf{tɛ̀ʔ} \textbf{ve} 'let a fart' is here broken up by the pre-head versatile verb \textbf{qɔ̀ʔ} 'go on to V'.}, the crab pinched and hung onto her pussy.

4. So then the grandmother said to her grandchild, ``Please bite into it and break
it, my child!'', but the kid said, ``Oh, it stinks too bad, Granny!''
