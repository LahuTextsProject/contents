{\Large{}\textbf{17 Sprits that Bite and Those that Don't}}

{\Large{}[Tape II, Side 1 \#8]}

{\Large{}1. This spirit, you see, when this master-spirit is hungry for meat, he
takes a pitchfork [1] and hooks it fast onto a human being, [so that] if he [=the
human] doesn't feed him tasty food, he will fiercely make the human being waste
away.}

{\Large{}2. But if the man goes to consult the spirit-doctor [3] the doctor [will
say]:}

{\Large{}3. ``The reason why your body has become so thin is, that the
sky-spirit wanted to eat delicious food through you, so he has treated you this
way. }

{\Large{}4. ``However, if you cook up some good-tasting food and feed it
to him, you will be cured. }

{\Large{}5. ``If you don't feed him, that pitchfork will stay hooked onto
you. }

{\Large{}6. But [4] as soon as you do feed him, he'll take it all away, and your
body will be healthy [again].``}

{\Large{}7. This kind of spirit can also start to cause trouble [5] for the whole
household. }

{\Large{}8. However, as far as the kind [of spirit] that cannot bite goes, we simply
pay homage to }

{\Large{}them, mark you! [6] }

{\Large{}9. We do not worship the kind that can bite. }

{\Large{}10. If we were to speak about what forms [7] the biting kind of spirits
have, seeing as how there are so many of them, since they are everywhere--water-spirits,
rock-spirits, mountain-spirits, valley-spirits, tree-spirits, thunder-and-lightning-spirits--there
are all kinds of spirits.}

{\Large{}11. But even though there is such a large number of them, this kind of
spirits that can bite are all inferior to us human beings. }

{\Large{}12. This is the way the matter stands.  }
