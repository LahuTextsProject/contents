\textbf{17 Sprits that Bite and Those that Don't}

[Tape II, Side 1 \#8]

1 This spirit, you see, when this master-spirit is hungry for meat, he takes a
pitchfork1 and hooks it fast onto a \{human being / man\}, [so that] if he [=the
man] doesn't feed him tasty food, he will fiercely make the human being waste away.2
But if the man goes to consult the spirit-doctor,3 the doctor [will say]:

3 ``The reason why your body has become thin is, that the sky-spirit wanted
to eat delicious food through you, so he has treated you \{this way / like this\}.
4 However, if you cook up some good-tasting food and feed it to him, you will be
cured. 5 \{If you don't / Unless you\} feed him, that pitchfork will stay hooked
onto you. 6 But4 as soon as you do feed him, he'll take it all [away] and your
body will be healthy [again].``

7 This kind of spirit can also start to cause trouble5 for the whole household.
8 However, as far as the kind [of spirit] that cannot bite goes, we simply pay
homage to them.6 9 We, er--we do not worship the kind that can bite.

10 If we were to speak about what forms7 the biting kind of spirits have, seeing
as how there are so many of them, since they are everywhere--water-spirits, rock-spirits,
mountain-spirits, valley-spirits, tree-spirits, thunder-spirits--there are all
kinds of spirits.

11 However--nevertheless--even though there is such a large number of them, this
kind of spirits that can bite are all inferior to us human beings. 12 This is the
way the matter stands.
