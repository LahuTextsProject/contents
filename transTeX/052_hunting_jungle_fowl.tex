52 Hunting \{Jungle-Fowl/ Wild Chickens\}

\. When the time comes to \{trap/ entrap by trickery\} wild fowl† in the mountains,
we Lahu just love to trap them.

\. [We] really want to do it.

\. Early in the morning we carry a [decoy] jungle-fowl and climb up into the mountains,
and when we hear the sound of jungle-fowl calling we're really happy.

\. When we hear the sound, we release [the decoy], and when [the other birds] come
they fight viciously [with the decoy], and when we see this we carefully cock our
\{rifles/ guns\} and fire them off, and if we see them die we're very happy.

\. We quickly take them and stuff them in our shoulder-bags, and the hunters who
killed them come close [to receive our congratulations].

\. This is one thing that makes the Lahu very happy.

\. This last couple of days when we went to trap jungle fowl, \{it was [the fallen
leaves] were\} very dry and crinkly, so when I saw a jungle chicken and tried to
shoot it, I slipped and couldn't get the shot off.

\. This morning I'm not in a very good mood.

\. I can't even enjoy my food.
