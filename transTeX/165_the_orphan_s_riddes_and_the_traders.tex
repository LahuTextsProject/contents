{Note: The Orphan hero of this story, as in others in this collection [give

{(Recorded in Pashú Village)[1]}

{1. <clears throat>    }

{Our great teacher [2] has come to visit our Pashu village, and he says
he'd like to hear a traditional Lahu story.[3]}

{2. So I'll just say one or two words.}

{***}

{3. Once upon a time there was an orphan child called Cà-}{\LARGE{}šɨ́}{-thî.[4]}

{4. Since he was very poor he had nothing to eat from day to day.}

{5. So when he was off scooping up frogs, he put dried things into starlings'
nests.}

{6. Then he had a riddling contest [5] with a great Chinese trader.[6]}

{7. ``What's that inside [the nest] over there?'', the orphan asked him.}

{8. The Chinese trader said, ``What should there be? There are only bird's
eggs!,'' he said.}

{9. ``Wrong!'' he [the orphan] said. ``Inside there is a dried-up frog.''}

{10. So why don't you just climb up and get it, I'll watch you,'' he [the
orphan] said.}

{11. When he [the trader] went climbing up to fetch it and took a look at
it, [the orphan said] ``Do you see the dried-up frog?'' [7]}

{12. So they kept going on and on, and when they reached a certain place
over there [8], the orphan looked around and saw another starling's nest.}

{13. ``That starling's nest over there, what's inside it?'' speaking in
riddles with him.}

{14. ``There are starling's eggs in it over there,'' he said.}

{15. ``Wrong!'' he said. ``In it over there, in that bird's nest over there,
there's a dried-up eel,'' he said.}

{16. But the Chinese trader didn't want to believe what this orphan, Cà-}{\LARGE{}šɨ́}{-thî,
was saying.}

{17. Since he didn't believe it, Cà-}{\LARGE{}šɨ́}{-thî climbed
up to look and found a dried-up eel.}

{18. So in this way the Chinese trader riddled with him, but nowhere [9]
could he beat Cà-}{\LARGE{}šɨ́}{-thî.}

{19. So they kept going on and on, and when they got to a certain place,
he [the orphan] said, ``Here, inside that tree-hollow, what is there?''}

{20. ``Inside that tree-hollow there are bird's eggs,'' said the Chinese
trader.}

{21. Cà-}{\LARGE{}šɨ́}{-thî said, ``You're wrong! Inside that
tree-hollow there is a super-dried-up [10] pa-dâ-qō [11] fish,'' he said.}

{22. But the Chinese trader didn't believe there was a super-dried-up pa-dâ-qō
there.}

{23. ``Well then, if you don't believe it, why don't you just climb up and
have a look,'' he said.}

{24. ``Okay, okay, in that case I'll go try to climb up and get it,'' [12]
he said.}

{25. When he went climbing up to try and get it, [the orphan said], ``Is
there a super-dried-up pa-dâ-qō up there?''}

{26. In this way, since Cà-}{\LARGE{}šɨ́}{-thî was an orphan,
he had to make a living by his riddles.}

{27. So they kept going on and on, and in a certain place over there, [the
orphan] said, ``Well, what is there on top of that tree?''}

{28. When [the trader] looked over there he said, ``I don't see anything
at all!''}

{29. ``You're wrong!'' he said. ``On top of that tree there's a little baby
dove.''}

{30. So Cà-}{\LARGE{}šɨ́}{-thî scrambled [13] up to look.}

{31. Since the Chinese trader didn't believe him, when he climbed up to
look, he got a little baby dove.}

{32. When he got the baby dove, the Chinese trader said, ``Oh, sell it to
me! This baby dove of yours.''}

{33. ``I can't do it,'' he said. ``Not me. It's mine to take care of.''}

{34. Then he said, ``Oh, please sell it, this thing of yours! So how much
would it cost?''}

{35 So the orphan said to the Chinese trader, ``How much will you give me?
How much will you give? How much would you be willing to pay? [14], Cà-}{\LARGE{}šɨ́}{-thî
said.}

{36. ``Well, then, for this baby dove I'll give you five rupees [15],''
he said.}

{37. So the Chinese trader gave him five rupees.}

{38. He [the orphan] went back, and when he got home he bought a chicken
