162 The Blind Man, the Cripple, and the Turtles

1 Once upon a time, a blind man and a cripple, leading each other along, went into
the jungle, and when the two of them had gone to a place there to spend the night
on \{the road/the journey\}, before they settled down for the night they caught
two turtles.

2 When they had caught the two turtles, the cripple made the blind man pick him
up and carry him.

3 At this point a tiger came by, and when he came sneaking up to have a look, he
said, ``Ah, there are two people over there, I'll eat them.\footnote{The story-teller says nɛ̀-Á nɔ̀ chèʔ-câ tù ve ``The two of us will}

4 I'll bite into them and eat them all up!''

5 And meanwhile [the two of them] went along together, taking the turtles with
them, and went to have a look; and [the tiger] looked at them and said ``Oh, this
one has heads on both sides! I can't it it!''

6 So then one of the turtles asked the tiger to kindly pick him up and set him
down on top of a tree-stump, so he could also just have a look [at the two-headed
animal].

7 But when [the tiger] picked [the turtle] up in his mouth and set him down, he
fell off, he kept picking him up and setting him down, but he kept falling off.

8 Finally [the tiger] violently picked him up in his mouth and threw him away.

9 He roughly grabbed him with his mouth and threw him away.

10 Once the turtle had been grabbed and thrown away he went inside the carrying-basket
of the blind man and the cripple.

11 And so as they went on, continuing on their way, going on and on, ah! they reached
a place to sleep --- the two of them got there and lay down, and they slept the
whole night through, they slept and slept, slept deeply and they woke up in the
morning when the sun was already high, and they \{stood up/rose\} and went on and
on, entering the \{dwelling place/abode\} of the Phi-tan-ngweh (one-eyed jungle
monsters).

12 And when they got there [a monster] said, ``I'm going to eat you two all up!'',
and he said ``Let me take a look at your lice!''

13 Saying they [the turtles] were their lice, they took the turtles and showed
them to him [the monster].

14 ``Oh, these lice are bigger than we are --- we can't eat them!'', they said.

15 Then (they said), ``Let us see your comb!'', and they took a rake and showed
it to them.

16 ``We can't eat them!'' they said there.

17 So then, this time coming back again\footnote{Note the concatenation qɔ̀ʔ qɔ̀ʔ v.V V `coming back again'.} from the [monsters'] place there where
the two of them had gotten to, when they reached a certain point on the road, there
was \{in the distance/over there\} a bird's nest nestling in a tree top.

18 So then the hunchback\footnote{Here for the first time called cɔ̄-qɔ̀ʔ-pā ``crooked back one'' instead} made the blind man climb up it while he watched.

19 When he climbed up there, [the cripple] said ``Did you reach it yet?'', and
he said ``Not yet''; ``Did you reach it yet?'', ``Not yet.''

20 Then when he had reached it, [the cripple] said ``Grab it!'', and when he grabbed
it, inside the bird's nest there was a snake!

21 When he looked, when this blind man tried to look at it, ``It's a snake!'' he
saw,\footnote{His vision had miraculously been restored because of his fright.} and roughly flung it away, sending it down [from the tree], and the cripple
jumped up and ran away, and that [crooked] place in his leg had straightened out.

22 His leg now straightened, and his eyes now seeing, the two of them together
went along again, and things were now very fine, and they returned home.
