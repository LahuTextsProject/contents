{\LARGE{}\textbf{\#162 The Blind Man, the Cripple, and the Turtles}}

{\LARGE{}1 Once upon a time, a blind man and a cripple, leading each other along,
went into the woods, and when the two of them had gotten to a place to spend the
night on their journey, before they settled down for the night they caught two
turtles.}

{\LARGE{}2 When they had caught the two turtles, the cripple made the blind man
pick him up and carry him.}

{\LARGE{}3 At this point a tiger came by, and when he came sneaking up to have
a look, he said, ``Ah, there are two people over there, I'll eat them.}

{\LARGE{}4 I'll bite into both of them and eat them all up!''}

{\LARGE{}5 And meanwhile [the two of them] went along together, taking the turtles
with them, and [the tiger] went to have a look and said, ``Oh, this one has heads
on both sides! [1]  I can't eat it!''}

{\LARGE{}6 So then the turtles asked the tiger to kindly pick them up and set them
down on top of a tree-stump, so they could also just have a look [at the two-headed
animal].}

{\LARGE{}7 But when [the tiger] picked [the turtles] up in his mouth and set them
down, they fell off, he kept picking them up and setting them down, but they kept
falling off.}

{\LARGE{}8 Finally [the tiger] violently picked them up in his mouth and threw
them away.}

{\LARGE{}9 He roughly grabbed them with his mouth and threw him away.}

{\LARGE{}10 Once the turtles had been grabbed and thrown away they went inside
the carrying-basket of the blind man and the cripple.}

{\LARGE{}11 And so as they went on, continuing on their way, going on and on, and
ah! they reached a place to sleep. The two of them got there and lay down, and
they slept the whole night through, they slept and slept, slept deeply, and they
woke up in the morning when the sun was already high, and they got up and went
on and on, entering the dwelling place of the Phi-tan-ngweh .[2]}

{\LARGE{}12 And when they got there [the monster] said, ``I'm going to eat you
two all up, so let me take a look at your lice then!``}

{\LARGE{}13 Saying that they [the turtles] were their lice, they took the turtles
and showed them to him.}

{\LARGE{}14 ``Oh, these lice are bigger than I am --- I can't eat them!'', he said.}

{\LARGE{}15 Then (he said), ``Let me see your comb!'', and they took a rake and
showed it to him.}

{\LARGE{}16 ``I probably can't eat them!'' he said there.}

{\LARGE{}17 So then, this time coming back again [3] from the [monster's] place
where the two of them had gotten to, when they reached a certain point on the road,
there was in the distance a bird's nest nestling in a tree-top.[4]}

{\LARGE{}18 So then the hunchback [5] made the blind man climb up [to get it] while
he watched.}

{\LARGE{}19 When he climbed up there, [the cripple] said ``Did you reach it yet?'',
and he said ``Not yet''; ``Did you reach it yet?'', ``Not yet.''}

{\LARGE{}20 Then when he had reached it, [the cripple] said ``Grab it!'', and when
he grabbed it, inside the bird's nest there was a snake!}

{\LARGE{}21 When he looked, when this blind man tried to look at it, he saw that
``It's a snake!''[6], and roughly flung it away, sending it down [from the tree],
so that the cripple jumped up and ran away, and that [crooked] place in his leg
had straightened out.}

{\LARGE{}22 [The cripple's] leg now straightened, and [the blind man's] eyes now
seeing, the two of them went along together again, and things were now very fine,
and they returned home.}
