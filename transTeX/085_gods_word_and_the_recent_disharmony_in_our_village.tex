[Sermon: Pastor Cà-bo]

\. What we \{must have/need\} is people who help others, and people who are humble
in spirit.

\. We must be able to have patience.

\. We must be tolerant and broadminded.

\. We must not say unrighteous or unjust things.

\. Thus we have been taught.

\. However, let us carefully consider what it says in the Bible about this:

\. Even though all of us humans say this---although God has been teaching us his
word, and is continuing to \{guide/lead\} us, why is it that we humans can say
such ugly things?

\. Why are we capable of uttering such things?

\. Let's think about this now.

1\. When I think about it, I am---that's the way it is, right?---\{being/ acting
as\} the leader who is guiding your whole \{group/community\}.

1\. But your friends, the brethren on the committee \footnote{kɔ̄mītī: a group of respected villagers consulted by the headman and} \{are also like that/play
a similar role\}.

1\. \{They/We\} are the ones who help the community, who guide it, who help people.

1\. However, do not [go so far as to] say that we in leadership positions are guiding
and helping others.

1\. Even we for our part have in full measure done unrighteous things, been proud
and haughty, gone against God's will, and have lacked \{patience/humility\}.

1\. Therefore, since we \{behave/are\} this way, all those who follow us also have
now \texttt{<}seen\texttt{>} their own strength \{grow less/diminish\}.

1\. For this reason all of us Christians must think things over.

1\. The disciple Paul says, ``We \{must have/need\} in \{the/our\} community all
the people who look after, care for, and help [others], those who are tolerant
and broad-minded.''

1\. Anything which would break up and divide our community should not be considered
by us. \footnote{Evidently serious disputes within \{Huey Tat/the village\} had led to a threat}

1\. We should not consider it.

2\. We must not consider things which would bring us to ruin and destruction.

2\. No matter how others may treat us, no matter how they may scold us, whatever
they may say to us, we must remain humble and patient.

2\. We haven't managed to accomplish [this] yet.

22a. Let us consider why we brethren haven't yet managed to do that.

2\. For what reason can't we do it?

2\. In a certain place in the Bible it says ``your heart, your soul, your strength
and \{spirit/ health\} \{everything belongs to/all belong\} to God.''

2\. Give it all up to God!

2\. Yet for us human beings it's \textit{my} heart, soul, strength and \{spirit/health\}
\textit{my} wealth and property, \textit{my }household---it's all mine and I myself
control it.

2\. It's because of this [attitude] that we have not succeeded.

2\. What does it say in another part of the Bible about this ``I myself control
it''?

2\. ``In your heart there is a sacred dwelling place \footnote{chɛ̂-kɨ̀ bo-yɛ̀: `dwelling' + `holy house, temple'} for the holy spirit.''
[Corinthians 3:16, 6:19 -- note by DB]

3\. Do not let it be a dwelling place for \{Satan/the evil spirit\}

3\. In that second part of the Bible it says that.

3\. But is our dwelling [i.e., body] place the temple of God's Holy Spirit?

3\. This body of ours is Satan's temple, Satan \{rules/controls\} it, we have allowed
Satan to rule it.

3\. Since I all by myself cannot take care [of things], I let Satan rule me.

3\. And when he let him rule, and when Satan takes care of us, when he ``improves''
us in his image\footnote{This translation is meant to convey the ironic tone of qɔ̀ʔ gu la ve tê}, what happens?

3\. We quarrel and bicker with each other, we don't get along harmoniously, we
act contrary to God's will, we cut ourselves off from what God has ordained.

3\. That's how it has come to be within the hearts of us human beings.

3\. Besides this happening, now it's become nothing but quarreling and bickering,
fighting and squabbling.

3\. Today we'd like to consider this disharmony, people not listening to what anybody
else is saying, all these things.

4\. Let each and every one of us consider this.

4\. If all this is according to God's will, then \{fine/ all well and good\}.

4\. If it's according to God's will then we can continue this way in the future.

4\. But if it's not according to God's will, once we have walked on the \{path/road\}
that is contrary to God's will, we will \{be destroyed/come to grief\}.

4\. We will be ruined and destroyed.

4\. Besides being ruined and destroyed, we will not be cared for by God, and you
can't put your trust in \{Satan/the Evil Spirit\} either.

4\. The Evil Spirit will not help you, and God won't \{care for/take care of\}
you either.

4\. Our community will not make progress, will not prosper in the future.

4\. These are the things we'll [have to] face.

4\. We who are Christians are all \{capable of sin\}.

5\. There is no one who is not a sinner.

5\. However, among God's words it is said that one ought to respect during the
time that has been granted for sinners to repent.

5\. We should repent \{properly/in the right way\}.

5\. My brethren, let us think over everything that has happened recently.

53a. Let us consider this with extra special attention.

5\. What was it that we put our trust in that has made us become like this---was
it because we did put our trust in God's word that we became like this, or was
it because we did \textit{not} trust in God's words that we became like this?

5\. If we all had truly put our trust only in God's words, we could not have become
like this.

5\. We could not have become like this.

5\. During the past two years, because we loved and esteemed each other, \{happily/cheerfully\}
helped one another, and listened to what each other was saying, we were able to
do God's work, that's how it was.

5\. The reason is, during those two years, even though we didn't give everything
[we owed] to God, we gave him our hearts, so \{it could be that way/we got along
fine\}.

5\. But now we can't accomplish anything anymore.

6\. What it says in another passage, in Philippians, what does it say?

6\. We who have already become Christians should all have our thoughts, beliefs,
actions, and hearts \footnote{dɔ̂-qhâ, tā-qhâ, te-qhâ, ni-ma:} on a single path. (Philippians 2:1-2 -- DB)

6\. And our hearts \footnote{tê caɨ tí: `one heart only'. Cà-bo here uses the Shan word caɨ `heart'} should be united in love.

6\. What do you think, brethren, are there several different ways of loving?

6\. There are not.

6\. There is only one.

6\. As for beliefs, are there several different ways to believe?

6\. There are not.

6\. There is only one.

6\. We received but a single one.

7\. But when we \{think about/consider\} this matter, there are many problems.

7\. We Christians do not speak harmoniously one with the other.

7\. It's gone so far that even if one person simply insults somebody else that
\{sin/offense\} is never forgiven.

7\. Think about it.

7\. Jesus, the son of God, was totally free from sin.

7\. He sacrificed himself upon the cross for your sins.

7\. People spat upon him

7\. They beat him, they reviled him, they cursed him, until they killed him on
the cross.

7\. What did Jesus say?

7\. ``Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,'' \footnote{More literally, ``Father, they, not knowing, do this to me; forgive their sin.''} Jesus said. (Luke
23:34 -- DB)

8\. And yet we human beings, even if we have only been insulted a little bit, we
cannot forgive that \{sin/offense\}.

8\. How much this must sadden the heart of God!

8\. Everybody read [this] in the Bible and think it over!

8\. Our community going and splitting up is not according to God's will. We cannot
be content this way.

8\. The thing is, we must love one another.

8\. In another passage in John I \footnote{Couldn't find it either in the Gospel of St. John, or in chapter 5 of The First}, what does it say?

8\. In Chapter V, ``Dearly beloved, the Lord Jesus loves us so very deeply that
we ought to love one another.''

8\. Jesus would say that.

8\. The way Jesus loved, that's how we ought to love one another.

8\. If we do not love each other, in the future how will we be able to do the work
that will \{bring about God's kingdom on earth/``make God's country progress''\}?

9\. Brethren, there is nobody living on earth who does not make mistakes.

9\. [We] make mistakes.

9\. But even though we are prone to err, while God has given us the time to repent,
we should all repeat and \{get on with things/continue as before\}!

9\. Just as I have communicated the words of God to you, my brethren, everyone
ought to think them over and over and act on in the future.\footnote{te qay cɔ̂ : `ought to keep doing'}

9\. My brethren, do not just think of ideas that will ruin us and split us apart!

9\. The thing is, if we entertain such ideas, besides its being extremely depressing,
there's another thing---it would be a hame for us in the eyes of others.

9\. The other day we were happily listening to God's words, and together we resolved
to unite our hearts, through thick and thin\footnote{hā-thɔ̂-ša-thɔ̂: lit. ``difficult-even-easy-even.''}, in spite of how angry we might
have been with each other, and we had made progress up to today.

9\. \{But/So\} today it's all of a sudden like this, and our community has the
idea of ``let's split up,'' which is inconceivable! \footnote{mâ dɔ̂ tɔ̀ʔ: ``not think emerge''}

9\. Therefore, in the future everybody should think this over carefully.

9\. When you ``intend to act,'' think carefully.

10\. When you ``intend to eat,'' sniff first.

10\. There is still time to somehow get better, to somehow have an easier time,
to somehow come up in the world in the future.

10\. We're not dead yet.

10\. God has not yet called us back to him.

10\. Within the time that has been allotted to us, let all of us think things over
and continue as before.

10\. Today this is all that I have prepared about the words of God.

***

10\. If there is anything that the headman or members of the committee want to
let \{everybody/the whole congregation\} hear about, there is time.
