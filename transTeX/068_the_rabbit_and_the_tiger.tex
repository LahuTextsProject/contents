68 The Rabbit and the Tiger

<told by Headman Cà-bí>

1. H: We-e-ll, brethren of mine, I'll just tell you a story about how a rabbit
and a tiger matched wits with each other! Do you want to hear it? Who wants to
hear it?

2. Several voices: \{I want to hear! I want to hear          \{I want to hear
too!

3. They say that long, long ago rabbits were very \{clever/ smart/ intelligent\}.

4. And in the old days tigers didn't bite people and eat them.

5. They didn't even eat raw meat.

6. Rabbits lived among humans, and tigers lived among humans.

7. One day a tiger and a rabbit \{made friends with each other, became friends\}
and went along together towards a place where humans were living.

8. When they got there, Rabbit\footnote{Rabbit evidently reached the human habitation before Tiger did. From now on we usually omit the article and capitalize the animals' names. They are usually referred to with the determiner \textit{chi} `this': \textbf{patây chi} `this the rabbit'\textbf{ lâ chi} `this the tiger'.} said to a child, ``Oh look there! That tiger
says that when your father and mother come back from finding you food he'll also
be waiting to eat with you all.''

9. When he said this, he was \{betraying/ deceiving\} Tiger, that rabbit was.\footnote{i.e., he was blowing Tiger's cover. The humans probably wouldn't have been willing to share their food with him, having been forewarned.}

10. Rabbit was very smart, so he ran the hell away.\footnote{\textbf{ phɔ  gèʔ-e}. \textbf{gèʔ-e }(< \textbf{gɛ̀} `be fast') is an intensifier added to certain verbs (esp. of motion). DL 408 FLEE INTENS}

11. As for Tiger, he frightened the children in that [human] house, the little
kids in that house, and they were crying!

12. When the father and mother came home, [the father] took a knife and chased
after Tiger, slashing at him and \{beating/ striking at\} him.

13. Tiger for his part followed the path over there that Rabbit had taken a while
before, saying [to himself], ``Rabbit betrayed me, so I'll just bite and eat him\footnote{\textbf{chèʔ câ ve}: the usual Lahu expression for being devoured by an animal. BITE EAT},''
and he went chasing after Rabbit.

14. Rabbit went on and on, and \{there in a certain place\} on the path he sat
down near a great bit pile of buffalo-shit and kept watch over it.

15. Tiger said, ``The one who betrayed me just now must have been you. Today I'm
going to eat you up.''

16. R: ``No, no! It sure wasn't me'' he [Rabbit] said.

17. T: ``What are you doing there?'' he [Tiger] said.

18. R: Long, long ago, in the age of my ancestors, in the time of my \{ancient/great\}
forefathers, they gave me this stool\footnote{The pun with stool = excrement is fortuitous!} and made me sit near it and watch over
it,'' he said.

19. T: ``Oh, I beg you to let me sit on it for a while!'' said Tiger. If you say
it in Shan, he said ``\textbf{yɔ̂n naŋ ít nɨŋ}.''\footnote{Lit. ``beg to-sit-one-time.'' This story is evidently of Shan origin, since this Shan phrase stuck in the narrator's mind. See also Sentence \#28.} That means ``Let me
sit for a while.''

20. R: ``Oh, that's impossible. In the time of my ancient forefathers, they said
that if I let anybody else sit on it, it would collapse!

21. ``However, I can't not let you sit on it,'' said Rabbit to Tiger.

22. When Tiger started to sit down, Rabbit jumped up, turned around, and ran the
hell out of there.

23. Tiger sat down heavily,\footnote{\textbf{  g̈ɔ̀ mɨ}: the prehead versatile verb \textbf{g̈ɔ̀} (lit. ``drag'') gives a vigorous meaning to the head verb. vV Vn} and the buffalo-shit stuck to his arse in a big
\{yellow/brown\} gloppy mess.

24. When the buffalo-shit stuck onto him, Tiger said, ``That Rabbit deceives people!''
and he suddenly went chasing after him again.

25. When he chased him down again, he said ``The one who lied to me must have been
you.''

26. Rabbit was sitting up on a crooked branch of a tree, near a great big honeycomb,
with his ears drooping, saying to Tiger that he was watching over a huge gong.\footnote{I.e., Rabbit pretended that the bees' nest was a gong.}

27. Then when [Tiger] said, ``Rabbit, you're tricking me,'' [Rabbit] said ``No-o-o!
Ages ago in my forefathers' time they entrusted me with this great duty'' [to watch
over the gong].''

28. ``Oh, I beg you to let me try striking it once, please let me strike it just
once!\footnote{Tiger says it first in Shan (\textbf{yɔ̂n mâun}), then in Lahu (\textbf{lɔ̀ dɔ̂ʔ})    BEG STRIKE  BEG STRIKE} Tiger said.

29. ``Impossible,'' said Rabbit. ``Impossible.''

30. ``Oh, please I beg you to let me strike it!'' said Tiger.

31. ``Well, if you do strike it, I'll just have to jump up and turn around,'' said
Rabbit, and he jumped up and ran away.

32. Tiger then smashed his fist into the honeycomb over there.

33. The bees went inside [his body] and bit him, and his nose got all swollen,
his mouth got tiny,\footnote{Because of the stings around his mouth, his oral orifice was almost completely blocked.} his mouth swelled up, his head and his face got huge.

34. So then Tiger said, ``That Rabbit lied to me\footnote{Lit. ``lies to people,'' but the non-3\textsuperscript{rd} person benefactive Pv \textbf{lâ} shows that Tiger means that \textit{he} is the object of deception.}!'' and went chasing after
him again―he was quite expert at following trails, that Tiger.

35. He was always chasing to attack.

36. Some distance away [Rabbit] had coiled a green pit viper\footnote{\textbf{ vɨ̀-nɔ }\textit{Trimeresurus popeorum}. Only slightly venomous, but with a very painful bite.} around a black
log, an old dried out piece of wood by the side of the road in an abandoned field,
and put it to sleep warming itself in the sun.

37. ``Rabbit, you deceived me,'' he [Tiger] said. ``I'm going to bite into you
and eat you up, this very day.''

38. ``Oh, no!'' he [Rabbit] said. ``Long, long ago, in the time of my forefathers,
in the time of my \{grandparents/grandpa + grandma\}, they put me in charge of
guarding this curved tobacco-pipe.''

39. So Tiger said he would like to try smoking\footnote{He uses a Lahuized Shan loanword \textbf{lùʔ} for `smoke'.} it just once. (He was using
the Shan language, [as was normal] long, long ago.) ``I'd like to try smoking ust
one puff from that big pipe.''

40. ``Impossible, pal of mine!\footnote{Rabbit uses the friendly Shan-derived word \textbf{šahÁy} `buddy; pal', ult. Pali \textit{sahāya }`friend, ally'. See DL: 1158.} I have been entrusted with it since the time
of my ancient forefathers,'' he said.

41. Well, he \{finally could not but/ended up having to\} let him have a smoke.\footnote{\textbf{ tɔ}: causative of \textbf{dɔ̀ }`drink; smoke (tobacco)', like Jse. \textit{tabako wo nomaseru }< \textit{nomu} `drink; smoke'.}

42. So tiger eagerly went for that green head of the pit viper, that coiled-up
head, thinking that even one puff would be delicious, and his great big mouth swelled
up

43. So then―and this was not all\footnote{\textbf{mâ qɔ̀ʔ hêʔ šē}: lit. ``still not the case this time.'' See DL: 972}―Rabbit ran the hell away again and [Tiger]
raced after him, and over there in a place in the mountains, a human being who
was arranging some thatch-grass to pick up and carry home caught sight of the rabbit.\footnote{Note the sequence of four verbs (\textbf{šɔ̄ chi pû qòʔ}), expressing a series of consecutive actions.}

44. ``Rabbit, where are you going?'' he said.

45. ``Oh, there's a tiger that's chasing me to eat. The tiger is running after
me and beating me.\footnote{\textbf{ g̈àʔ  dɔ̂ʔ  lâ    ve}: ``pursuing me with blows.'' chase beat 1\textsuperscript{st} p. recipient} I'm nearly dead. Where could I go to escape [him]?''

46. ``Come inside my load of thatch-grass!'' said the human to Rabbit.

47. Whoosh!\footnote{\textbf{chɛ̂ʔ-kàʔ} : onomatopoetic adverbial} He went into the load of thatch.

48. Well, having followed him again, Tiger got there, all amazed with buffalo-shit,
with swollen eyes where the bees had stung him, with his mouth swelled up where
the viper bit him\footnote{\textbf{ vɨ̀-nɔ chèʔ tā ve mɔ̀ʔ-qɔ bÁ ɛ̀ qay lɛ}: Clause added by JAM.}, and said, ``Haven't you seen a rabbit around here?''

49. ``No, I haven't,'' he [the human] said.

50. ``Wow, you're such a tiny little person, but your load is so big! Let me carry
it a little,'' said Tiger.

The human said, ``That's impossible.''

So he begged him, ``Pu-leeze\footnote{Tiger uses the Shan word \textbf{yɔ̂(n)} `beg' instead of normal Lahu \textbf{lɔ̀}. See sentence \#28, above.} just let me carry it a little!

``Your load is too big for you!''

So then [the human] said to Tiger, ``Let's make an end to your damn\footnote{This expletive translates \textbf{qhɛ} (Pv) `iterative excess'. At this point the human gives Tiger the load to carry.} begging!''

From inside that thatch something was going \textbf{khɛ̂ʔ-khɛ̂ʔ}!\footnote{Onomatopoetic adverb: ``with a scratching sound, like a match on sandpaper.'' DL: 379.}

Hey, I wonder what's inside your thatch? Something is going \textbf{khɛ̂ʔ-khɛ̂ʔ}!''
he [Tiger] said.

``Oh, it's just the thatch rattling around,'' he said.

It was Rabbit inside there that was \{lighting a fire in the thatch/ setting the
thatch on fire\}.

Tiger was staggering under the weight.

It was going \textbf{tɛ̂ʔ-tɛ̂ʔ}

A flint had been struck there.

`` Oh, I wonder what in the world is in your thatch! It's going \textbf{tɛ̂ʔ-tɛ̂ʔ}
now.''

``The thatch is just rattling around,'' the human said.

All of a sudden the thatch \{burned brightly/ caught the hell on fire\}; the flames
leapt high.\footnote{\textbf{ À-mī  bô ɛ̀ʔ  tòʔ   qhâ, a 	̀-mī-ha tòʔ qhâ} fire brightly burn VIOLENT ACTION flame    id.  id.}

[Tiger] didn't have the sense to throw it away, you see, so he ran away all in
fire, not looking for human beings anymore, and fled \{as deep as he could\footnote{\textbf{ qhɔ̀ nÁ chò phɔ e}. Correlative adverb \textbf{qhɔ̀...chò}. DL 307-8.}
into/ into the most overgrown parts of\} some old abandoned fields.

Well, there were large herds of horses and cattle grazing there.

``Mr. Ox, Mr. Horse,\footnote{Tiger adds the male name prefix \textbf{cà} to the animals (\textbf{cà-nû}, \textbf{cà-mû}), which creates a humorous humanizing effect, since most traditional Lahu men's names were derived from the day in the 12-day calendrical cycle when the boy was born. See DL 448-451.} where \{could might\} I run away to today?''

``Run into the most overgrown part of the abandoned field over there,'' they said.

When he tried to flee into the deepest part of the abandoned field he was burning
so badly that his flesh became \{all striped/ covered with big stripes\},\footnote{As tigers are to the present day!} that
mighty tiger.\footnote{\textbf{lâ-qhâ-pɨ}: a more dignified name for the tiger than simply\textbf{ ̂}.}

He couldn't flee \{to a safe place/successfully\}.

So then, after running and running he caught sight of a water-buffalo bathing in
a buffalo-wallow.

``Oh, Mr. Buffalo, today I'm burning almost to death. Where can I run to get away?''

``Come on in here,'' he [Mr. Buffalo] said.

When he went into the pool the fire died, the fire just died.

The charred parts where the fire burned him, some of those burnt spots were now
black and others were \{blue/ green\}, his eyes were \{swollen/ puffed out\}, his
mouth had become huge, he had sat on a pile of buffalo-shit, and those black-and-blue
stripes―he was a terrible mess!

That hive of bees that he hit mistaking it\footnote{Lit. ``naming it a gong.'' See DL: 1012.} for a gong bit into him so his eyes
swelled up.

And the pit-viper making his mouth all \{bent out of shape/ crooked\} was because
he [Rabbit] had told him [Tiger] that it [Mr. Viper] was a pipe, a crooked tobacco-pipe,
so he said he would just take a puff, and [the viper] bit into him and his mouth
got all swollen.

After that he got burned until he had stripes of bare\footnote{\textbf{ní ɛ̀} (AE ext): `something red; something bare, naked' DL 765-6.} flesh, all red and raw\footnote{\textbf{qɛ̀ʔ-qɛ̀ʔ-lè-lè}: DL 249.},
and ran to the cattle, ran to the horses, but wasn't saved.

They just showed him the way to an abandoned field.

When he reached a pool he went into it \{with a water-buffalo/ where a water-buffalo
was\}, and was saved.

So to this day, even if a water-buffalo should do something against God's will,
even if he is guilty of sins and crimes, a tiger will not bite him.

But a tiger has no respect for horses or cattle.

To this very day tigers eat them.

And that's the story.
