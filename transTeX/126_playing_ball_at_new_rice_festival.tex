[playlet and conversation]

Headman, Teacher, Paul, others

1 Càlɔ̂: Well, Pastor, there's something I'd like to hear about. You say that
the Lahu play ball[1] after they finish celebrating[2] the Rice-From-New-Paddy
Festival[3]? How do you play? Can you explain it to me a little?

2 T: Well, sure, I can explain it to you. When we've finished scarphing[4] the
New-Rice feast, we hit the ball around. We (who call ourselves) Lahu do it every
year, and we have a great time![5] So today we'll get to play ball.

3   : Who all will play?

4 H: Oh, all the men in the village play. When it comes to ball-games, everybody
wants to play.

4a (inaudible)

5 T: Let's go to it, then! Let's go! Hang up the net and let's go!

6   : Can't the women play?

7 T: Women aren't allowed to mix in and play along with the men. The men might
get itchy hands[6]!

8 Boy: Ha, ha, ha.

9 H: The women play among themselves[7] at a different time. They don't mix in
with the men, the women.

10 T: Would you like to mix it up then, you women?

11 His wife: I'm game!

(T laughs)

12 C: How many people will be on a side?

13 H: It's good if there are about eight or nine people on a side. The place where
we play is wide.[8]

14 T: (pretending to misunderstand) Eight plus nine people[9]--that's ridiculous,[10]
what you're saying. There would be too many people on one side!

15 H: Nine people \textit{all together}, nine all together! Can't you understand
simple Lahu?10 When I said \texttt{"}eight or nine people,\texttt{"} I meant nine
people at most.[11]

16 T: In that case--

17 Matisoff: Can I play too?

18 T: Sure you can. The White Man[12] wants to play together [with us].

19 C: Let's play! Well, who's going to serve?[13]

20 H: Oh, \{sure it is to me / I'll take it\}! I'll take the ball!

21    : O.K., here!

22 H: \{Keep your eye on it now! / Pay attention now!\}[14] I'm going to hit it
at you! Pap!

(He imitates the sound of smacking the ball. Laughter.)

It fell out of bounds, out of bounds!

23 T: Keep quiet! Don't break in with your laughter, boys![15]

24 C: What's the score now?[16]

25    : Oh boy, oh boy!

26 H: This one still went out of bounds. A point [for them]. The ball has stopped.[17]
Hey, again, you guys, hit it again! Oh, it fell out of bounds this time, too.

27 C: How many points for your side now?

28 H: My side has three points now.

29 C: Three, eh? How many points do you need to win?[18]

30 H: Twenty-one.

31 C: Twenty-one.

32 T: If the other side doesn't get a single person--I mean, doesn't get a single
\textit{point}, we only play up to twelve.[19]

33 H: Right, they haven't scored yet. We're going to get our eleven points. Give
it a good whack!

34    : You're wrong! It's only eleven [points that you need for a shutout].

35    : We only play up to eleven [if the other team hasn't scored].

36 C: Now what's the score?

37 H: We've got nine points now.

38 C: Nine points, eh?

39 H: Mm-hm.

(Some time has presumably elapsed)

40 T: My side has 15 points already![20]

41 C: Yeah, you've almost won now!

42 H: \{They're touching their upper limit then[21]! / They're near the top then!\}
But my side is too, remember.

43 T: In a minute you'll know.[22] Hurry up and play, come on! Just serve it in
here!

44 H: I'll sock it to you! Tat!

(He imitates the sound of hitting the ball. Laughter.)

45 T: You guys, push it into the middle [of their court]! Into the middle.

46 H: Hit it in, right into the middle.

47 T: Don't push it away off to one side or the other.

48 H: Just hit it right into the middle.

49 C: What's the score now? Isn't it about twenty by this time?

50 H: Nineteen for my side. And we're going on tuh-wenty[23]!

51 T: Eighteen for us.

52 C: Well, there's only one point to go now.

53 T: You serve, C--you serve.

54 C: O.K., I'll serve.

55 H: Hit it!

56 C: There it goes.[24]

57 T: Hm, it landed way over on that side!

58 H: Twenty-then twenty-one. We've almost won. Jut one point [more].

59 C: They've almost won.

60 H: I'll rap it right back at you! I'll rap it right back!

61 T: This time let Maw (hit it back / return the serve\}--Maw[25]!

62 H: I'm hitting it now. Just listen to this!

(sound-effect)

63 T: Oh, it came right between C's legs[26]!

64 H: Well, you couldn't handle it, you guys. Probably because you haven't played
in a long time, right?

65 C: Yeah.

66 H: Because you're awfully heavy-handed.[27]

67 T: Thu-shwe, what the hell were you doing anyway! I told you to hit it back
/ get (the ball)\}, and you go and take it easy[28] like that--it's really[29]
disgusting.

68 C: Well, I guess they've won this time, those guys.

69 H: We've won now--we win!

70 C: All right, let's switch sides and play again.[30]

71a H: We'll switch sides.

71b C: We'll switch sides.

72 H: Hm. The sun is awfully hot for us on this side. We want to be on the other
side. The sun's really in our eyes.[31]

73 T: (presumably having gone over to the sunny side) It does dazzle your eyes,
doesn't it?

74 H: Yeah, it's really blinding. And the sun is awfully hot.

75 C: Okay, we're all through playing now, right?

76 H: We're all through playing. A pause]

77 H: Well, I'm going to give all of you ball-players a prize! If you were on the
winning side you'll get something [a little] more valuable.[32] I've bought you
a ace that's worth fifty baht, and I'm going to give it to you. The winners get
two-thirds, and the losers get to eat one-third of it. So divide it up and get
it! Get together here[33]--/It's all put down here for you./ /Put down all your
pieces together so we can be fair about dividing it up./

78 P: This is fun, isn't it?

79 H: Yeah.

80 T: Well, I'm not eating anymore. 'Cause I didn't win.

81 H: Haha, we're eating away, having a great time. You guys are no good [at the
game].[34]

82 T: Stuff yourself,[35] stuff yourself, eat yours fill all by yourself!

83 P: You say you'll play again next year, right?

84 H: How much money are you going to put out next year then[36]?

85 T: As much as a hundred and fifty.

86 H: I [put up] fifty baht this year. How many of you people will be sharing[37]
[in the prize], on your side?

87 T: Eight or nine.

88 H: Eight or nine people, eh. On my side there aren't too many people, you see.
There are only six. Well, so this 150 that you're \{contributing / putting in\},
will you give all of it to the winners?

89 T: Yup. I'll give (them) the whole thing.

90 H: I bet you'll get mad! Suppose you don't win, [after putting up] such an amount![38]

91 T: What do you care if I'm mad! It's no skin off your nose if I'm mad, you know.[39]

92 H: You'll be very upset if you lose.

93 T: Even if I'm upset, I'll keep it inside myself. You people wont' suffer for
it.

94 H: O.K., go ahead, then, go ahead! We'll beat you. When we played that time
last year, didn't you lose fifty baht? A child--

95 T: It was more like five baht, I'd say.

96 H: You couldn't even beat the boys, the children[40]! Even though you were all
grown men. No skill, that's all.[41]

97    : Oh, you 'grown men' are no good for anything. If you want to play again,
just go right ahead. Bet as much as you like[42]!

98 T: Unless it's at least a hundred[43] I wouldn't want to do it at all.

99 H: Who are all the best people that you've got? Hurry up and go bring them [here]!

100 T: There isn't a single one of my people--on my side--who isn't good. Every
last one of them is fine!

101    : (laughing) Does that include the two white men[44]?

102 T: I'll still have the white men on my side.

103 H: On my side I've got a Northern Thai too! This Thai guy is very strong.

104    : What's his name?

105 H: The Thai on my team?

105A  : Yeah.

106 H: The Thai on my team is called Ai-Shwe--Ai-Shwe. He's really good, I tell
you.

107    : Where did you say he lives?

108 H: Wh--I hear he lives at Pà-ta-nà-pə̂ʔ.[45]

[laughter]

He's coming over to us for a visit.

109 P: What does this \texttt{"}Pà-ta-nà-pə̂ʔ\texttt{"} mean?

110 H: \texttt{"}Pà-ta-nà-pə̂ʔ\texttt{"} means, in Northern Thai--

111 T: What he means is the place down there called \texttt{"}Pà-ta-lâ-pəʔ\texttt{"}!

112 H: \texttt{"}nà-pə̂ʔ,\texttt{"} I tell you! It's not a \texttt{"}mouthful
of tea\texttt{"}![46]

113 P: Did you say \texttt{"}là-pə̂ʔ\texttt{"}?

114 H: \texttt{"}nà-pə̂ʔ, nà-pə̂ʔ\texttt{"}! \texttt{"}pà-ta-nà-pə̂ʔ\texttt{"}!

115 T: What's the meaning of this \texttt{"}pà-ta-nà-pə̂ʔ\texttt{"} then?

116 H: When these folks[47] down there say \texttt{"}nà-pə̂ʔ\texttt{"} in their
language \texttt{"}nà-pə̂ʔ\texttt{"} that is, it might possibly mean \texttt{"}a
waterfall, a cascade\texttt{"}[48] in Lahu. That's probably true, that's what they
mean by it.

117    : It might mean \texttt{"}the path you go on to fetch water.\texttt{"}

118 H: What?

119    : I said \texttt{"}the path you go on to fetch water.\texttt{"}

120 H: I don't know at this point. Since it's a foreign language we don't know
the meanings properly.

121 T: That's not the way you say \texttt{"}to fetch water.\texttt{"} In Northern
Thai you say \textit{paj tÁk nÁam}.[49]

122 H: They say \texttt{"}paj-tÁʔ-na-pə̂ʔ.\texttt{"} It means \texttt{"}go
fetch water.\texttt{"} It means \texttt{"}go to carry water (back),\texttt{"} I
tell you! It means \texttt{"}go carry water.\texttt{"} That's true!

[having run this into the ground]

123 P: So he's a pretty good ball-player, this Thai of yours?

124 H: He's great. He says he's had practice.[50] He's managed to get schooling
in all sorts of places in the city.

125 T: What rank[51] did he get [in school] then?

126 H: Well, in Lahu we have no way of saying what his rank was. In white-man's
language he was \texttt{"}Number Two.\texttt{"}

127 T: \texttt{"}Number Two\texttt{"} isn't so wonderful! What's good is \texttt{"}Number
One.\texttt{"}

128 H: \texttt{"}Number Two\texttt{"} is still pretty damn good.

129 T: On our side we have them. On our side everybody's got a \texttt{"}Number
One\texttt{"}!

130 H: Well, you didn't win! \textit{We} were \texttt{"}Number One\texttt{"} today.

131 T: Because our people were a little off their form, you see.[52]

132 H: Ha! You're Number One, and we're Number Two![53]

133 T: We had a white-man on our side.[54]

134 H: Even your Number One white-man couldn't beat us Number Two people today.
You're Number One and we get Number Two. No I mean \textit{we} get Number One and
\textit{you} get Number Two.[55]

135 T: We won't know until next year.[56] We won't know till next year.

136    : My side even the Big Boss[57]--

137 P: How many times a year do you have this ball-playing of yours?

138 T: Well, this ball-playing goes on every evening, if there are people around.[58]

140 H: If there only are people around, we play every day.

141 T: When we play every evening we don't make bets on it.[59] But when we play
on a day like today, as we're celebrating our Rice-From-New-Paddy Festival, then
we also match some money against each other.

142 H: Well, the best ones at this ball-playing are the white men, aren't they?
The white men are very good at it.

143 P: Haven't you ever played football[60] then?

144 H: Kicking, you know--since there aren't any flat places up here in the mountains,
we can't do any kicking. But as far as kicking [itself] goes, if we had a place
to kick, we could kick all right. Even the Lahu have done some kicking in their
time.[61]

145 T: Yes, indeed! If we had a flat place, we'd love to \{kick a ball around /
play football\}, the white men on one side and the Lahu on the other!

146 H: We'd never beat the white men.

147    : We'd win, we'd win!

148 H: The white men are awfully good. They're very clever.

149 T: Once in a while--

150 H: We Lahu aren't very clever.

151 P: Is this[62] really a traditional Lahu game that we've been talking about?

152 T: Well, if you must bring up the tradition question,[63] it's really a white
man's custom.

153 P: What about really traditional Lahu games, what sort of things are there?

154 T: Well--

155 P: Is it just spinning the top[64] [that you can call your own sport]?

156 T: We certainly do spin the top, we Lahu--

157 P: You say that this top-spinning is a genuine Lahu thing, eh.

158 T: It's the real thing.

159 P: Is it the only kind [of sport that is really Lahu]?

160 T: Yes, spinning the top.

161 P: When do you play it, this top-game?

162 T: You mean spinning the top?

163 H: When we celebrate New Year's.

164 T: At New Year's.

165    : At Christmas[65] too, I'll bet.

166 T: We play both at New Year's and at Christmas.[66]

167 P: How many days do you do it?

168 T: Well, we play it for about a week, see[67]?

169 P: Can you tell me a little bit about this top-spinning? How do you go about
it?

170 T: Oh, I can certainly tell you [all] about spinning tops, my friend.[67]

171 P: How do you win at it, how do you play it?[68]

172 T: This top-spinning is done \{in pairs / two people at a time\}.

173 H: You pair off[69] and set it spinning!

174 T: Let's say you and I, the two of us, are paired and we play. When you set
it spinning[70], I have a go at it [with my own top]. Everybody gets divided up,[71]
into one side or the other.

175 H: You take a good piece of string,[72] and onto the butt-end of the top--er--you
tie it firmly to a stick, then you wind it carefully around your[73] top and send
it spinning off,[74] then when you've got it whirling away round and round, [the
other player] hurls [this top] against it.[75]

176 P: But what's that you said about \texttt{"}pairing off[76]\texttt{"}?

177 T: \texttt{"}A pair\texttt{"} means \texttt{"}you and me, the two of us\texttt{"}!

178 H: (simultaneously with 177) You and I make \texttt{"}a pair.\texttt{"} When
you set it up, I strike at it.[77]

179 H: Let's say ten people on the other side have had their turn[78] striking,
and then [it's your turn to] set one up. You set it up, and one of their fellows
strikes at it--that's how it's done. *When there are many people on one side, they
can't [all] strike out [at once]. There's no time for them to each have a turn
one after the other. But two people could strike [at the same time]. Even three
people could strike [at the same time].79 (*tê pÁ ve chɔ cɔ̀ mâ qo mâ dɔ̂ʔ
phɛ̀ʔ ve. nî g̈â kàʔ dɔ̂ʔ phɛ̀ʔ ve)

180 P: Suppose you strike at it but don't hit it--

181 H: If you don't hit it you lose.

182 T: You just lose!

183 H: When you strike and do hit it, then the other fellow's [top] goes jumping
away--ahh[80]!--it jumps, jumps, jumps, jumps away!

183a  : Is it like--[the rest of the sentence is unintelligible]--?

184    : It jumps off every which way.[81] I'll let fly at yours until it breaks!

185 Matisoff: Do only children play?

186 H: Grown-ups play too.

187 T: Children also play.

188 H: Everybody who's good at it plays.

189 P: The losers have to do the setting-up, right[82]?

190 H: Once they're forced to be setters-up, they'll do the setting up forever.
Even if [the game lasts] the whole day long, the losers have got to [keep] setting
'em up. While the winners keep on winding up [the string around their tops] and
[firing off strikes with all their might. They play until they're ready to drop.

191 T: White men probably don't play with tops, I daresay.

192 Matisoff: No, they don't.

193 P: They probably don't. Only the children play around with them.

194 T: I see.

195 H: It's not that way with the Lahu.[83] Even the adults play with all their
might. As long as there's a little light--almost the whole day long we play as
hard as we can. In joy and gladness, until we're wiping away our sweat, we Lahu
have a great time at it.

196 T: Our foreheads get red as fire![84]

197 H: And the sweat comes dripping off us! The sweat pours off us!

198 P: Where is it that you people play the top game?

199 H: In a flat place like over there--

200 T: We play in a flat place, like over there, in a flat place.

201 H: We choose up sides properly, and carefully draw the boundary-line, then
you can only stay below that line! You mustn't step over it, or go up beyond it....
