{\large{}1 Well, now, once there were two men. }

{\large{}2 These two men both went into the jungle, and caught a monkey--they had
gone monkey-hunting. }

{\large{}3 After they caught the monkey they went to sell the monkey-meat to a
Shan. }

{\large{}4 The Shan said: ``šahÁy, nə̀ i-šÁ ɛ̀?`` }

{\large{}5 That means ``Friend, what kind of meat is it?`` [1]}

{\large{}6 Now the two of them didn't know the Shan language at all. }

{\large{}7 So when they were spoken to, they kept quiet. [2] }

{\large{}8 They didn't know what to say. }

{\large{}9 ``You, you tell him!`` they said (to each other), and
they remained silent. }

{\large{}10 Well the Shan kept asking them again and again, ``nə̀ i-šÁ
ɛ̀?`` }

{\large{}11 Finally, [3] they said ``Meat live in tree, meat live in tree!``
