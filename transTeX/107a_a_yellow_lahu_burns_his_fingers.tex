\textbf{107a A Yellow Lahu Burns his Fingers}

[Tape X, Side 1]

[107a-d originally told in Y.L., then translated into B.L.]

1 Once upon a time there were two men.1 2 [This is about how] one day the two of
them picked some \{cabbages / mustard-greens\} to boil up for a curry:2 3 They
got up to the fields, and when noontime came the two of them were looking for [something
to] \{cook / boil up\} for a curry. 4 So the Yellow Lahu said to the Black Lahu:
"Let's go boil up some \{cabbages / mustard-greens\}." 5 After
a while they went and \{cooked / boiled\} the cabbage. 6 They cooked it, and it
came to a boil.3 7 After it was done, when he4 had mixed up some salt and hot peppers
[in a dish], he said "Friend, scoop out a little, will you?"
8 Then, after a few seconds,5 he \{repeated / said [again]\}, "Friend,
scoop out a little salt, will you?" 9 Now the way the Black Lahu said
it was because he didn't understand the Yellow Lahu dialect. 10 So that he [ended
up] making the Yellow Lahu scoop out some \textit{cabbage}. 11 Well, it was burning
hot, and the Yellow Lahu jumped--er, the Yellow Lahu ran away [in pain].
