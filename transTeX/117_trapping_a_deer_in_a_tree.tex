117 Trapping a Deer in a Tree

\. Once upon a time there were an older brother and a younger sister. \footnote{\textbf{ɔ̀-u-phâ} `elder brother; maternal uncle; guardian of a young girl'}

\. The two of them would go to set animal traps day after day.

\. When he went to set his trap, the older brother climbed up to the top of a tree
and set it there.

\. As for the younger sister, she set hers on the ground.

\. Well this time they went to check out their traps.

\. When she checked her traps, the sister's was set on the ground, so a barking
deer \footnote{\textbf{chɨ-(pí)-qwɛ̀ʔ}: \textit{Cervulus muntjac}. A small deer prized} was caught in it for her \footnote{The benefactive Pv \textbf{lâ} is used here, although it usually refers to}.

\. So then the brother was the one to go check his trap.

\. When the brother went off, the sister also went \{softly/quietly\} sneaking
after him to have a look.

\. And there was her brother climbing up to the top of a tree carrying the animal
she had caught!

1\. So when the sister said, ``Why are you carrying it up?'' he said to her, ``Oh,
I'm carrying it down, I'm carrying it down!''
