1. Today I talked things over with a friend of mine and we went to dam a stream
to catch fish.

2. In the right-hand fork.

3. There were delicious carp there!\footnote{Lit.,``A delicious fish is the carp!'' This Red Lahu sentence is not quite grammatical in Black Lahu, since \textbf{à} `asseverative' is a verb-particle in BL, but in this sentence it is occurring after a noun. A more normal BL sentence would be: \textbf{pa-mô} \textbf{lɛ̀} \textbf{ŋâ} \textbf{mɛ̀} \textbf{à} \textbf{lɔ}.}

4. I have never seen a fish more delicious than a carp.

5. Having gone off to dam for fish, going off to look for carp, we reached the downstream
end, then taking the left-hand fork up there to the head of the stream, we climbed
up from downstream and arrived up there at the hilltop, then we turned back and
when I got home I shared [the fish] with my relatives.

6. I shared them with the headman and the assistant headman, I shared them with
the elders, with the old folks and with all the young guys who couldn't go [fishing].

7. There was no one that I did not share it with.

8. I shared it all for them to eat.

9. I don't know whether everything that I caught tasted good or not, but I did it
just the same.
