1 Today I talked things over with a friend of mine and we went to dam a stream
to catch fish.

2 In the right-hand fork.

3 There were delicious carp there!

4 I have never seen a fish more delicious than a carp.

5 Having gone off to dam for fish, going off to look for carp, we reached the downstream
end, then taking the left-hand fork up there to the head of the stream, we climbed
up from downstream and arrived up there at the summit, then we turned back and
when I got home I shared [the fish] with my relatives.

6 I shared it with the headman and the assistant headman, I shared it with the
elders, with the old folks and with all the young folk who could not go [fishing].

7 There was no one that I did not share it with.

8 I shared it for them to eat.

9 I don't know whether what I caught tasted good or not, but I did it just the
same.
