5\. The General Conference of Christian Lahu at Shatodu Village

\. I'd just like to say a few words  about the meeting that we held this year,
1965, at Shatodu village.

\. This is the story.

\. All of us brethren---Karen, Lahu, white people---we all met together.

\. For that we greatly praise the grace of God.

\. Then, having \{met together/ assembled\} we studied the Word of God.

\. The \{Words of God/ divine words\} that we studied were Ephesians 5:1\.\footnote{In the King James translation, the verse is: ``But all things that are reproved}

\. Jesus is our chief.\footnote{\textbf{ó-qó}: `head; principal part'}

\. We Christians must always \{take refuge in/ depend on/ have recourse to\}\footnote{The Lahu verb is \textbf{cû}. For a study of its etymology, see JAM 1989:}
Jesus.

\. That's the story.

1\. May God's blessing be upon us forever!
