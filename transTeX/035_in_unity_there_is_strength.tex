35 In unity there is strength (a moral tale)

1. Once upon a time there was a man who had five sons.

2. Every day all they did was quarrel with each other.

3. What one would say the other \{wouldn't listen to/ would ignore\}

4. So having seen this, their father said to them:

5. ``My boys, every day you quarrel with each other.

6. `` You don't get along with one another.

7. ``Break off a stick from a \{tree/ bush\} and bring it to me.

8. ``Each one of you break one off and bring it to me,'' he said.

9. Then, as their father had told them to, the sons broke them off and carried
them off to where their father was.

10. ``[Now] each of you try to bend and snap the sticks you broke off,'' he said.

11. At this point, when the sticks they had each broken off were bent, all at once
they snapped \textit{crack-crack} .\footnote{cɛ̂ʔ-cɛ̂ʔ (Adv. onomat.): sound of dry sticks breaking, mice munching paddy, etc.}

12. Afterwards he [the father] sent them to break off [sticks] again.

13. Having sent all his sons to go back again to break off [more sticks] to carry
back, they set them down \{in their father's presence/ before their father's eyes\}.

14. This time the father tied [them] nicely together, then he had [his sons] bend
[the bundle], one after the other.

15. Even though one [son] after the other, bent (it), it wouldn't snap.

16. Then the father said, ``My sons, if each of you stays by himself, just the
same as [we saw] a while ago, \{with the/ just like\} bending \{of\} those sticks,
you will be \{destroyed/ ruined\}.  You will have to fail [in life],'' he said.

17. ``Just as you [saw when you] bent [them] again this time, if you all stick
together and are united in feelings with each other \footnote{ni-ma  tê  šī   tí  te  ve: ``making only a single heart''  heart   one round obj. only make NMLZR}, even if others should
try to harm you, you will not be destroyed,'' he said.

18. Well, it's just the same with us Christians too.

19. If we put our trust in the lord Jesus Christ, we will achieve \{everlasting
precious life/ immortality\} .\footnote{co-  tèʔ-  ha-  tèʔ:  life  precious body, soul precious body}

20. If we do not place faith in the lord Jesus Christ, we will fall into temptations
to sin.

21. Therefore I would like to sing a little song about how if we put our trust
in the lord Jesus Christ, the Precious Son of God, we will achieve everlasting
life:

22. [sings] Do welcome gladly God's Precious Son,

And you will win Life Eternal.
