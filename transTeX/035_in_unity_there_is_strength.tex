35 In unity there is strength (a moral tale)

\. Once upon a time there was a man who had five sons.

\. Every day all they did was quarrel with each other.

\. What one would say the other \{wouldn't listen to/ would ignore\}

\. So having seen this, their father said to them:

\. ``My boys, every day you quarrel with each other.

\. `` You don't get along with one another.

\. ``Break off a stick from a \{tree/ bush\} and bring it to me.

\. ``Each one of you break one off and bring it to me,'' he said.

\. Then, as their father had told them to, the sons broke them off and carried
them off to where their father was.

1\. ``[Now] each of you try to bend and snap the sticks you broke off,'' he said.

1\. At this point, when the sticks they had each broken off were bent, all at once
they snapped \textit{crack-crack} \footnote{cɛ̂ʔ-cɛ̂ʔ (Adv. onomat.): sound of dry sticks breaking, mice munching}.

1\. Afterwards he [the father] sent them to break off [sticks] again.

1\. Having sent all his sons to go back again to break off [more sticks] to carry
back, they set them down \{in their father's presence/ before their father's eyes\}.

1\. This time the father tied [them] nicely together, then he had [his sons] bend
[the bundle], one after the other.

1\. Even though one [son] after the other, bent (it), it wouldn't snap.

1\. Then the father said, ``My sons, if each of you stays by himself, just the
same as [we saw] a while ago, \{with the/ just like\} bending \{of\} those sticks,
you will be \{destroyed/ ruined\}.  You will have to fail [in life],'' he said.

1\. ``Just as you [saw when you] bent [them] again this time, if you all stick
together and are united in feelings with each other \footnote{ni-ma  tê  šī   tí  te  ve: ``making only a single heart''}, even if others should
try to harm you, you will not be destroyed,'' he said.

1\. Well, it's just the same with us Christians too.

1\. If we put our trust in the lord Jesus Christ, we will achieve \{everlasting
precious life/ immortality\} \footnote{co-  tèʔ-  ha-  tèʔ:}.

2\. If we do not place faith in the lord Jesus Christ, we will fall into temptations
to sin.

2\. Therefore I would like to sing a little song about how if we put our trust
in the lord Jesus Christ, the Precious Son of God, we will achieve everlasting
life:

2\. [sings] Do welcome gladly God's Precious Son,

And you will win Life Eternal.
