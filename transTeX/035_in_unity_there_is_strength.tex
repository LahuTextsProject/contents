{\Large{}1. Once upon a time there was a man who had five sons.}

{\Large{}2. Every day all they did was quarrel with each other.}

{\Large{}3. What one would say the other wouldn't listen to.}

{\Large{}4. So having seen this, their father said to them:}

{\Large{}5. ``My boys, every day you quarrel with each other.}

{\Large{}6. `` You don't get along with one another.}

{\Large{}7. ``Break off a stick from a tree and bring it to me.}

{\Large{}8. ``Each one of you break one off and bring it to me,'' he said.}

{\Large{}9. Then, as their father had told them to, the sons broke them off and
carried them off to where their father was. [1]}

{\Large{}10. ``Now each of you try to bend and snap the sticks you broke off,''
he said.}

{\Large{}11. At this point, when the sticks they had each broken off were bent,
they immediately snapped }{\Large{}\textit{crack-crack}}{\Large{} .[2]}

{\Large{}12. So then he sent them to break off [sticks] again.}

{\Large{}13. Having sent all his sons to go back again to break off [sticks] to
carry back, they set them down before       }

{\Large{}their father.}

{\Large{}14. This time the father tied them nicely together, then he had them bend
[the bundle], one after the other.}

{\Large{}15. Even though one [son] after the other bent it, it wouldn't snap.}

{\Large{}16. Then the father said, ``My sons, if each of you stays by himself,
just the same as a while ago, with       }

{\Large{}the breaking of those sticks, you will be destroyed.  You will have to
fail [in life],'' he said.}

{\Large{}17. ``But just as when you bent them again this time, if you all stick
together and are united in feelings       }

{\Large{}with each other [3], even if others should try to harm you, you will not
be destroyed,'' he said.}

{\Large{}18. Well, it's just the same with us Christians too.}

{\Large{}19. If we put our trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, we will achieve everlasting
life. .[4]}

{\Large{}20. If we do not place faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, we will fall into
temptations to sin.}

{\Large{}21. Therefore I would like to sing a little song about how if we put our
trust in the lord Jesus Christ, the       }

{\Large{}Precious Son of God, [5] we will achieve everlasting life:}

{\Large{}22. [sings] Do welcome gladly God's Precious Son,        }

{\Large{}And you will win Life Eternal.}
