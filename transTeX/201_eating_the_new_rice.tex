201 Eating the New Rice

1 Ah! Oh! Oh! This year, we of this community, all of us come together; oh you
who live in the land of the spirits\footnote{Lahu ritual prayers frequently make use of T'ai (Shan and Northern Thai) vocabulary} come and eat this new rice, come and drink
this new water!

2 All of your community [of spirits] also come, oh, whoever are elders [in the
land of the spirits], every one of them, everybody, come to this house, come to
eat, come to drink.

3 Come to eat, and let there be no troubled thoughts in this house; with this boon
once again cover us.

4 Once again cover us [with the boon that] the lives of the womenfolk, the lives
of the menfolk be as eternal as the white stone kɔ-mô up there.\footnote{kɔ-mô from kɔ-mô-twɛ̄ (etymology obscure). The kɔ-mô-twɛ̄ are roughly}

5 Oh, if we work for one day in the fields, may the food not be exhausted in ten
days; if we work for one year in the fields, may the food not be exhausted in two
years; with this boon once again cover us all.

6 If we work in the fields for one day, may the food not be exhausted in ten days;
if we work for one year in the fields, may the food not be exhausted in ten years,
in one hundred years; for this boon we once again wait, with this boon once again
cover us.

7 You who are all-knowing, all-true, oh you who rule over the heavens,\footnote{This is G̈ɨ̀-ša, the supreme and creating divinity of the Lahu.} you who
are all-wise, cover everybody of this house with the boon of the earth, the life
of the earth.\footnote{This means `grant that everyone's life may be as eternal as that of the earth'.}

8 This blessing open and with this blessing cover every one of us, that if we work
for one day in the fields, there may be sufficient to eat for ten years.

9 Once again grant and [with this boon] cover the life of the master of the house,
the life of the mistress of the house, the lives of the children, that they suffer
no decay, [that they may be as enduring as] the life of the stone kɔ-mô up there,
let nobody suffer from troubled thoughts; oh this boon open [upon them], with this
boon cover [them].
