{24}{\textit{ Building a House:}}

{T=Teacher (Pastor Cà-bo)}

{H=Headman (Cà-bí)}

{Issue: how much to vary translation of âa, which begins most of the turns.
Usually translated ``well.''}

{1. H: Well, we'll build a house.}

{2. T: Well, just how shall we build it, the house?}

{3. H: Well, once we've collected all the materials, we can do it!}

{4. T: Well, there's one thing we don't have enough of yet!  What we call
the roof-support beams [1] aren't enough yet.}

{5. H: Well, we'll just go and cut [2] some. We'll take one or two people
along.}

{6. T: With only two people you won't be able to carry them back [from the
forest to the village].}

{7. H: Let four people carry them, four people.}

{8. T: Yeah, as long as four people carry it, they'll probably succeed.}

{9. H: Let everybody look for all the other stuff, all the things [we'll
need].  You guys should select people, and go look for everything.}

{10. T: So who all will go with me---to go and cut some roof-support beams?}

{11. H: Well, Cà-qā, you should be one to go too!  Will you go?}

{12. Cà-qā: I'll go.}

{13. H: Cà-ye, please go too.}

{14. Cà-ye: I'll go.}

{15. H: That makes two people, right? Cà-bo, are you going too?}

{16. Cà-bo: Sure I am!}

{17. H: Thûyì, please go too.}

{18. Thûyì: OK.}

{19. H: That makes four people.  That's enough, right?}

{20. T: If we've got four people, that's enough.  Four people will carry
the beams for me, and when we've succeeded [in getting them to the building site]
we'll just put them in place!}

{21. H: Uh-huh.}

{22. T: What day shall we do it on?}

{23. H: I say we ought to do it on Tuesday.}

{24. T: Tuesday.}

{25. H: Yeah. As for food [3], what they'll feed you guys probably won't
be very tasty.}

{26. T: Well, there's enough canned carp [4] for the whole group, as far
as food goes. We Lahu we help each other!  It's not that we just look at what food
there is to eat!}

{27. H: We should just kill one or two chickens to eat.  In that case, a
great big cock and a hen, two nice fat animals, should be enough.}

{28. T: Oh, two chickens and a half should be enough!}

{29. H: <laughs> [5] Well, as long as they're big it'll
be enough.}

{30. T: How many people are there who would like to eat pork [6] then, among
all of you house-builders?}

{31. Kachin: Well, just the whole village --}

{32. Somebody: Well, I'd like to eat it too.}

{33. Somebody else: Well, as for me, I'll take the pig intestines---I love
to eat them.}

{34. T: Pā-ɛ́ [7] , what about you?}

{35. Pā-ɛ́: The kidneys, the kidneys.}

{36. T: The kidneys. Thû-yì, how about you?}

{37. TY: The stomach.}

{38. T: The stomach.}

{39. Kachin: Unless there's pig-meat it still won't be enough.}

{40. T: Well, I'd like to eat the [pig's] head boiled, the head boiled.}

{41. Somebody: I'd like to eat it too, your boiled head.}

{42. Headman: I'd like to eat the meat chopped up fine.}

{43. T: Sure, let everybody eat whatever he likes.}

{44. T: Well, then, [8] is there enough thatching-grass already, you guys
who are building the house?}

{45. H: Well, eighteen sheaves of thatch have arrived, it should be enough.}

{46. T: Oh, eighteen sheaves.}

{47. Somebody: Mm-hm.}

{48. T: If there are eighteen sheaves, that'll probably be more than enough.
