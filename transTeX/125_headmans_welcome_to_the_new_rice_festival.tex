\end{center}

\leftskip=0pt
1. Well, today our friends, our Caucasian brethren, have visited us, us hillfolk,
us

Lahu, and while we are celebrating the New Rice Festival they have come to participate

with us in joy and gladness.

2. And we, all of us, must welcome them happily to us.

3. Every one of us.

4. We will have fun.

5. It's a good thing, to do it this way.

6. The merit is very great.

7. And the Westerner has graciously provided food and drink for us, having bought

a pig for all of us, to feed us all, feeding us and giving us to drink.

8. The merit is very great, is it not!

9. Since the grace of God has reached all of us, we must praise Him, for God's
grace

is great and never-ending.

10. And today we are celebrating together, three Westerners, and three Karens,

together happily with us Lahu, preparing food and drink together, and since we
are

praising the grace of God for helping us, all of us can celebrate, and the merit
is very

great.

11. And besides this, since great and important people have become friends of all
of

us, if it were not for God's helping us, we would never have been the sort of people
who

would have been able to meet them.

12. The fact that people living in different countries, in different lands, because

of the grace of God, are celebrating together today, is indeed because God's grace
is very

great, is it not!

13. In the future we look forward to meeting each other again, and we will always
be

properly grateful for God's grace.
