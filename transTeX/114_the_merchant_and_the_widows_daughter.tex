114 The Merchant and the Widow's Daughter

1 Once upon a time there lived an older brother and a younger brother.

2 First the younger brother, carrying some perfume, went off to sell it.

3 He went off to sell it, he kept on going to sell it, until he came to a certain
place, until he reached a strange village, when he happened to climb up to a house,
a widow's house.

4 A little girl was there.

5 ``Little girl, where has your mother gone?'', he said, and she answered ``My
mother isn't home. She's gone to the fields.''

6 So then he said, ``If your mother were at home, I'd give her some sparkling red
balls!''\footnote{Complex pun [cf. explanation in \#33] ní-šī `red ball', nī-šī `testicle'.}

7 Then he went away, and after he had reached some other place he came back, and
when he went back up to that house, when he went up to it again, when he got there,
he said, ``Little girl, where has your mother gone?'', but this time also the mother
was not there.

8 ``If your mother were at home, I'd give her some sparkling red balls! Some sparkling
red balls! If she hadn't gone away, I'd also have given her 10 pieces of silver,''
he said.

9 After that he went back home, not having sold all his perfume he returned home,
and his older brother said, ``Hand it over, hand it over! Your big brother will
have a turn going there!''

10 So then the elder brother carried it in his turn, and set off again with the
perfume.

11 He went there and said, ``Little girl!''

12 He happened to come up to that same house, and said ``Where has your mother
gone?'', and she said ``My mother isn't home'' --- this time also when it was the
older brother's turn.

13 So he went off again and kept going --- er, when she said ``My mother isn't
home'', the older brother also said ``If your mother were only at home I'd give
her some sparkling red balls!''

14 So having said this again, after he had gone away and come back, this time the
mother was at home for him.

15 She came back and said, ``A while ago you said that you'd give me some red balls.
Let's see them!''

16 So he had taken some bright red fireflies at the outskirts of the village and
stuffed them into his shirt.

17 Having stuffed them in there, he said ``Run, run, into that other room!''

18 In the other room he unwrapped and released them and the whole house glowed
bright red, so [the mother] said, ``Oh, daughter, daughter, go get some water and
hand it over to me and I'll pour it!'', and the daughter got some water and when
she handed it over to be poured, it happened to be hot water, and it burned that
fellow's prick.

19 So then in a flash he suddenly jumped up and went out, he ran away and sat down
on a rock, and then while he was rubbing [his sore penis] the widow and her daughter
also happened to go off on the path where he had fled, and the daughter said, ``Mother,
mother, he's sharpening that thing that wasn't sharp enough to stick into us!''

20 That's the end.
