1. Once upon a time six stupid men went to dig up gophers.\footnote{\textbf{fâʔ-phî}: `gopher; bamboo rat' [\textit{Rhizomys sumatrensis}]}

2. Having dug for gophers, they caught seven of them.

3. So after they caught the seven animals, they proceeded to divide them up.

4. As they were dividing them up, one person sat in the middle and said, ``Here,
one for you; here, one for you; here, one for that guy; here, one for that other
guy''---dividing them up like this, the six people got six of the animals, but
one was left over.

5. So then when they repeated it again like this, dividing them up again, still
exactly one animal was left over.

6. When one of the guys\footnote{\textbf{tê} \textbf{g̈â} \textbf{phâ} `one of the guys' is a slangy way of saying \textbf{chɔ} \textbf{tê} \textbf{g̈â} `one person'.} took the one that was left over, he had two of them.

7. So they divided it up still again.

8. But even after they divided it again, [the last] guy got the two animals that
were left.

9. So all the livelong day\footnote{\textbf{tê-ni-tâ-vâ}: \textbf{tê} \textbf{ni} `all day' + \textbf{tâ-vâ} `id.' < Tai (Si. \textit{tháŋ wan}). The two equivalent expressions are juxtaposed for emphasis.} they kept on dividing up the gophers this way, until
they were all quarreling with each other.

10. Since they were acting this way, they took a very long time doing it, when
all of a sudden a hunter appeared.

11. When this hunter appeared, he said, ``Hey stupids, what are you all doing?''
When he asked them this, they said, ``We're dividing up these gophers, but we can't
agree about it, so we're offending each other like this.''

12. So the hunter said, ``Bring them to me, all the gophers!'' When he said this
they brought them together in one place.

13. The hunter quickly divided them up, saying, ``Here, one for you; one for that
guy; one for that other guy,'' and after he had divided up six of the animals among
the six people, the hunter took the remaining one for himself.

14. So then those six fools said, ``Now this is they way that a person who knows
how to divide does it!'', and they were very happy.

15. Ha, ha, ha!
