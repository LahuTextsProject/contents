60 The Six Stupid Men and the Gophers

\. Once upon a time six stupid men went to dig up gophers \footnote{fâʔ phî: `gopher; bamboo rat' [\textit{Rhizomys sumatrensis}]}.

\. Having dug for gophers, they caught seven of them.

\. So after they caught the seven animals, they [proceeded to] divide them up [among
themselves] \footnote{`Among themselves' translates dàʔ `reciprocal action'.}.

\. As they were dividing them up, one person sat amongst them and said, ``Here,
one for you; here, one for you; here, one for that guy; here, one for that other
guy''---dividing them up like this, the six people got six of the animals, but
one was left over.

\. So then, when they did it again like this, dividing them up again, still just
one animal was left over.

\. When one of the guys \footnote{tê   g̈â   phâ is a slangy way of saying chɔ tê g̈â} took the one that was left over, he had two of them.

\. So they divided it up again.

\. But even after they divided it again, [the last] guy got the two animals that
were left.

\. So \{all the livelong day/ the whole blessed day\} \footnote{tê-ni-tâ-vâ: tê ni `all day' + tâ-vâ `id.' \texttt{<} Tai (Si. thÁŋ} they kept on dividing
up the gophers this way, until they were all quarreling with each other.

1\. Since they were acting this way, they took a very long time doing it, when
all of a sudden a hunter appeared.

1\. When this hunter appeared, he said, ``Hey stupids, what are you all doing?''
When he asked them this, they said, ``We're dividing up these gophers, but we can't
agree about it, so we're quarreling \{this way/ like this\}.''

1\. So the hunter said, ``Bring them to me, all the gophers!'' and when he said
this, they brought them \{immediately\} all to one place.

1\. The hunter divided them up for them, saying, ``Here, one for you; one for that
guy; one for that other guy,'' and after he had divided up six of the animals among
the six people, the hunter took the remaining one for himself.

1\. So then those six fools said, ``Now this is they way that a person who knows
how to divide does it!'' and they were very happy.

1\. Ha, ha, ha!
