{\LARGE{}60 The Six Stupid Men and the Gophers}

{\LARGE{}1. Once upon a time six stupid men went to dig up gophers .[1]}

{\LARGE{}2. Having dug for gophers, they caught seven of them.}

{\LARGE{}3. So after they caught the seven animals, they proceeded to divide them
up.}

{\LARGE{}4. As they were dividing them up, one person sat in the middle and said,
``Here, one for you; here, one for you; here, one for that guy; here, one for that
other guy''---dividing them up like this, the six people got six of the animals,
but one was left over.}

{\LARGE{}5. So then when they repeated it again like this, dividing them up again,
still exactly one animal was left over.}

{\LARGE{}6. When one of the guys [2] took the one that was left over, he had two
of them.}

{\LARGE{}7. So they divided it up still again.}

{\LARGE{}8. But even after they divided it again, [the last] guy got the two animals
that were left.}

{\LARGE{}9. So all the livelong day [3] they kept on dividing up the gophers this
way, until they were all quarreling with each other.}

{\LARGE{}10. Since they were acting this way, they took a very long time doing
it, when all of a sudden a hunter appeared.}

{\LARGE{}11. When this hunter appeared, he said, ``Hey stupids, what are you all
doing?'' When he asked them this, they said, ``We're dividing up these gophers,
but we can't agree about it, so we're offending each other like this.''}

{\LARGE{}12. So the hunter said, ``Bring them to me, all the gophers!'' When he
said this they brought them together in one place.}

{\LARGE{}13. The hunter quickly divided them up, saying, ``Here, one for you; one
for that guy; one for that other guy,'' and after he had divided up six of the
animals among the six people, the hunter took the remaining one for himself.}

{\LARGE{}14. So then those six fools said, ``Now this is they way that a person
who knows how to divide does it!'', and they were very happy.}

{\LARGE{}15. Ha, ha, ha!}
