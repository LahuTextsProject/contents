1 Above the Precious Eternal Lake there was no abundance of trees to be found.

2 There was only the Tree of Eternal Life.

3 This Tree of Eternal Life split up and branched out, splitting up into branches
[which turned into] a crooked river with 99 bends, [but] there was no abundance
of trees to be found.

4 There were a few phɛ̀ʔ-qhwɛ̂ ferns,\footnote{See DL: 913.} these phɛ̀ʔ-qhwɛ̂ came into
being and were spread out on winnowing sieves, but there was no abundance of trees
to be found.

5 There were a few qā-ni trees,\footnote{See DL: 236.} these qā-ni came into being, winnowing sieves
and winnowing trays came into being, but there was no abundance of trees to be
found.

6 These were a few aquatic phɛ̀ʔ-qhwɛ̂ plants, and these aquatic phɛ̀ʔ-qhwɛ̂
plants had 99 branches.

7 However, one of the branches became a servant.

8 Another branch became a race of water creatures.

9 One branch became a servant, on branch, oh, one branch became a servant.

10 Another branch became a race of snakes.

11 But there was no abundance of trees to be found.

12 The race of water creatures --- er, the Tree of Eternal Life along, this Tree
split up nicely.

13 It split up very well, but when one branch fell down sambar deer came out.

14 When another branch fell, a wild boar came out.

15 Another branch fell and a human being came out.

16 Thus all kinds came into being and emerged there.
