{166 The Wicked Older Brother and the Good Younger Brother}

{1. Once upon a time there was a man who had two sons.  }

{2. Then later the man died, and the two sons were left.}

{3. So then the older and younger brothers divided up the property.}

{4. Dividing up the property, all the older brother gave his younger brother
were just two dogs and a curved     }

{bush-knife.[1]}

{5. As for the older brother, he got two oxen.}

{6. All the rest of the property he kept for himself too, the story says.[2]
}

{7. Well, one day when the younger brother was off clearing his swidden
with his curved bush-knife, he scooped     }

{up a white mushroom and munched it [3] and fell asleep.}

{8. Having scooped up the white mushroom and munched it and fallen asleep,
one day [4] a great troop of     }

{monkeys showed up and said, ``Ah, this person has died! His heart was very
pure. Let us pick him up and carry     }

{him  to where we'll perform a service for him. [5]  Let us sing hymns for
him,'' they said, and they picked him     }

{up and laid him down somewhere way up on a rock cliff.}

{9. Having carried him up there, they arrived at a cave, where they sang
hymns and ministered to him, that orphan.}

{10. Then they summoned a certain bird and had it sing hymns.}

{11. That bird having been summoned and made to sing hymns, he [the younger
brother] suddenly stood up      }

{and shouted, so all those monkeys ran away.}

{12a. Then, when he looked around inside the cave, he found silver and gold,
and he took it all and went back        }

{home,  where his elder brother said, ``Younger brother, how did you get
all this?``        }

{12b. ``Well, you once gave me a bush-knife. ``I cut down a mushroom with
that knife and munched it while I         }

{was clearing my field and I fell asleep, and a big troop of monkeys came,
and they said, `Oh, this fellow is         }

{dead! Blowfly eggs are swarming all over him! But his heart is pure', and
they picked me up and carried me,         }

{and we got to a cave, and they sang hymns for me and took care of me, and
I shouted at them and they ran         }

{away, and when I looked around the cave it was full of silver and gold.
So I took it for you and brought it        }

{back,''  he said. [6]}

{13. ``Oh younger brother, your older brother will go too! Older brother
will go do it too. Let me have your        }

{bush-knife,'' he said, and the older brother set off right away.}

{14. The elder brother set off, and while clearing his field he scooped
up a white mushroom and munched it       }

{and fell asleep, and that great troop of monkeys came and said, ``Oh, this
one's heart is very evil!`` But even       }

{so,  although his heart is evil, we'll do something for him, we'll help
him,'' so they picked him up and carried       }

{him up onto a rock cliff.}

{15. As they were carrying him up, when they reached the halfway point,
climbing and climbing up, he opened       }

{his eyes and said, ``Do it right, don't let go of me and let me fall!''
So those monkeys got frightened and let go       }

{of him so that he fell, and falling down there he landed right inside a
tiger's den.}

{16. After he landed inside the tiger's den, two or three days went by without
his coming back, so the younger       }

{brother was very worried, and went to look for him, and carried him back.
