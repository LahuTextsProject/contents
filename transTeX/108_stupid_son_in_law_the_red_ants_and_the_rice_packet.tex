{\LARGE{}\textbf{\#108 The Stupid Son-in-law, the Red Ants, and the Rice Packet.}}

{\LARGE{}1. Once there were two people.}

{\LARGE{}2. They went hunting.}

{\LARGE{}3. These two people, father-in-law [1] and son-in-law, were hunting porcupines.}

{\LARGE{}4. They arrived at an old-field [2] in a certain place, and the old man
made his son-in-law follow a trail in the upper part of the field, while he went
into the middle of the field.}

{\LARGE{}5. Then, when the son-in-law saw some red ants going up and down on a
tree stump, he said, ``Father-in-law, they've gone up already!'' [3]}

{\LARGE{}6. When these red ants went up, he said, ``Father-in-law, they've gone
up!''}

{\LARGE{}7. When he said this, the father-in-law climbed up, exerting himself he
ran up that hill.}

{\LARGE{}8. When those red ants came back down again, he shouted loudly, ``Father-in-law,
they've gone down already!,'' so the father-in-law kept on running up and running
down all the time, so he [finally] said, ``Aw, this son-in-law is no damn good!''
}

{\LARGE{}9. Having run up and down like that he said ``Son-in-law, lick this!''
