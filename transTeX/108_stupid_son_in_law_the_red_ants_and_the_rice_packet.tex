108 The Stupid Son-in-law, the Red Ants, and the Rice Packet.

\. Once there were two \{people/men\}.

\. They went hunting.

\. These two people, father-in-law \footnote{\textbf{ɔ̀-pū}: etymologically `grandfather' (\texttt{<} PTB *\textbf{bəw}),} and son-in-law, were hunting porcupines.

\. They arrived at an old-field \footnote{\textbf{hɛ-šā}: a field previously cleared for a swidden, now reverting} \{over there/in a certain place\}, and the
old man made [his son-in-law] lie in wait for game in the upper part of the field,
while he went into the middle of the field,

4a. then, when [the son-in-law] saw some red ants going up and down on a tree stump,
he said, ``Father-in-law, they've gone already!'' \footnote{The humor here resides in the father-in-law's misunderstanding of what was}

\. When these red ants went up, he said, ``Father-in-law, they've gone up!''

\. So the father-in-law climbed up, \{with all his might/exerting himself\} he
ran up, that hill.

\. When those red ants went down again, he said, ``Father-in-law, they've gone
down already!,'' so the Father-in-law kept on running up and running down all the
time, [so he said] ``Aw, this son-in-law is no damn good!''

\. He said this, right? Then he said ``Son-in-law, lick this!'' \footnote{chi ve lɛ̀ʔ ôʔ, lit. ``lick this,'' a shorter version of ŋà ve mɔ̂}, and he went
back [to s-i-l's house], and when he got there he met up with his son-in-law again.

\. So he said, ``Son-in-law, open up the rice that I wrapped up before.''

1\. ``But you said \{`Eat it/Lick it'\}!, so I ate it up,'' he said.

1\. When he [s-i-l] said this, the Father-in-law said, ``Aw, this son-in-law is
no damn good!'', and he went home [to his own house].
