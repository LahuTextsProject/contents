\textbf{70 Wooing the Maidens}

[Tape \#6, Side 2 (continued in \#77)]

1 Pà-ɛ́: Thû-yì, where are you going tonight?

2 Thû-yì: Well, I guess I'll go try \{courting the girls / wooing me a maiden\}
tonight.

3 Pà-ɛ́: Whereabouts?

4 Thû-yì: Oh, over there where all the girls are. i've been planning to have
a go at it.

5 Pà-ɛ́: When you go, call me, too, please. I'll just have something to eat
first.

6 Thû-yì: Well, the two of us are good friends, so let's \{get together / join
up\} and go.

7 Pà-ɛ́: People like us ought to join up and do it together.

8 Cà-lɔ̂: Won't you \{invite / call\} me, too, then?

9 Thû-yì: Oh, you can go, too, \{pal[1] / my friend\}! Now there are three!

10 Cà-lɔ̂: Yep.

11 Pà-ɛ́: The oldest one is mine!

12 Thû-yì: Oh, the best-looking one is mine!

13 Pà-ɛ́: It's impossible then.

14 Thû-yì: That's not right, old buddy. I'm the one who visited that \{girl /
one\} of yours first, you know!

15 Pà-ɛ́: You say you visited her first, but I never saw you do it![2]

16 Thû-yì: I've made a \{proper / regular\} \{engagement / betrothal\} with that
one!

17 Pà-ɛ́: Come on, now, as far as betrothals go,[3] you're not committed as
much as I am.[4]

18 Thû-yì: Well, in that case, I'll switch to that younger sister of hers.[5]
If you take \textit{her} on.

19 Pà-ɛ́: Go ahead, go ahead!

20 Thû-yì: You take on the older one--I'll take on the younger one.

21 Pà-ɛ́: Fine, fine.[6] That's how I had it planned anyway.

22 Thû-yì: What about you, my friend?

23 Cà-lɔ̂: Me, you mean?

24 Thû-yì: Yeah.

25 Cà-lɔ̂: I haven't even managed to have a proper talk [with anybody] yet![7]

26 Pà-ɛ́: Have a try at talking then.

27 Thû-yì: Well, let's get going in a few minutes.... Oh, our friend is going
to eat first now. Let's wait for him.

28  Càbo (to Thû-yì): Apparently this fellow's girl hasn't been much in the
mood for courting with him, my friend.[8]

29 Thû-yì: I don't know. He told me that when he went to have a private talk
with her,[9] she wouldn't even chat with him the way she should. [To Càlɔ̂]
It's probably because you didn't do a very good job of making conversation with
\textit{her}!

30 Cà-lɔ̂: The thing is I said too much to her. She didn't talk to\textit{ me}!
She must've been embarrassed, I guess.

31 Pà-ɛ́: Because you just haven't gotten to know each other yet.[10]

32 Cà-lɔ̂: Probably so--that's probably it.

33 Pà-ɛ́: After two or three nights, \{she'll / you'll\} probably get \{more
familiar / friendlier\}.

34 Thû-yì: Well, with me now, as far as conversation goes, when I go over there
she talks to me even if I sit on the ground [outside] without even going into her
house!

35 Cà-lɔ̂: Won't you please explain to me how you do it? Since I've never heard
[anything about how it's done]!

36 Thû-yì: Oh, boy![11]

37 Cà-lɔ̂: When you go, what's the first thing you say to the girl?

38 Pà-ɛ́: You take a stick and poke it through from underneath the floor.[12]
When she comes out you say \texttt{"}Have a chat with me!\texttt{"}

39 Cà-lɔ̂: You say \texttt{"}Have a chat with me,\texttt{"} eh?

40 \{Pà-ɛ́ / Thû-yì\} : Right, right.

41 Cà-lɔ̂: Then what does she say[13] to you?

42 Thû-yì: She says, \texttt{"}You say something first! What have you been thinking
about?\texttt{"} But we \textit{have} to tell her about our feelings.[14]

43 Cà-lɔ̂: What sort of thing?

44 Thû-yì: Whether we love her or not. She listens to what we say to her.

45 Pà-ɛ́: We've got to tell her \texttt{"}I love you!\texttt{"}

46 Cà-lɔ̂: You've got to say \texttt{"}I love you,\texttt{"} huh?

47 Pà-ɛ́: Yes.

48 Cà-lɔ̂: Can't you say \texttt{"}I don't love you\texttt{"}?

49 Pà-ɛ́: If we say \texttt{"}I don't love you,\texttt{"} then they won't love
us either.

50 Cà-lɔ̂: Hmm.

51 Thû-yì: But once we get her into the woods, we've got to ask, \texttt{"}What's
your real reason for coming out here [with me] tonight?[15] Did you come because
you like me?\texttt{"} Then she says, \texttt{"}Well, I came here because I've
been thinking about you. I wanted to have a good talk with you.\texttt{"}

52 Cà-lɔ̂: Then how do you \{go on / continue\} with it after that? Do you talk
about all sorts of things?

53 Thû-yì: Well, after you've had your talk, you write letters to each other
all day, and at night you go visit her.

54 Cà-lɔ̂: Which one is it that you say you'll marry? The one \{you visit all
the time / you're visiting\}?

55 Thû-yì: That guy[16] has taken her away from me now!

56 Cà-lɔ̂: Gee, there's no sense competing with each other like that, is there[17]?

57 Thû-yì: Oh, that guy[16] really \{gives people[17] a hard time / causes people
a lot of trouble\}!

58 Càbo: And the fellow is also very jealous, you know.

59 Pà-ɛ́: I am not jealous. She likes me as I like her!

60 Cà-lɔ̂: Wow, is this girl so beautiful then? Why is it that so many people
are fighting over her?

61 Thû-yì: Well, her body is beautiful. But her heart is fickle.[18] There's
nothing that can be done with her right now.

62 Pà-ɛ́: Her body's beautiful, all right. But her heart is fickle.

63 Cà-lɔ̂: How old did you say she is?

64 Thû-yì: If you figure her age, I'd say she's around diez y seis or diez y
siete.[19]

65 Pà-ɛ́: She's probably about seventeen.

66 Cà-lɔ̂: Can she read and write?[20]

67 Pà-ɛ́: Oh, she can read and write, too.

68 Cà-lɔ̂: How many grades did she finish[21], in her studies?

69 Pà-ɛ́: The Lahu don't have school-grades like that! All we know is our ABC's[22]!

70 Thû-yì: Well, when she writes letters to me, they're very nice, too! The handwriting,
I mean.

71 Cà-lɔ̂: What sort of thing does she write you? Won't you just read me a little
so I'll know[23]?

72 Thû-yì: She writes me things like \texttt{"}Now, amidst my constant thoughts
of you, I send you these few words[24]--This is what I want to say:\texttt{"} she
says. \texttt{"}Night and day I think only of you.\texttt{"}[25]

73 Cà-lɔ̂: Is that all? It couldn't be. It must be longer [than that].

74 Thû-yì: Well, there's still another part.

75 Cà-lɔ̂: Tell me all of it! I want to hear.

76 Thû-yì: She says, \texttt{"}\textit{You} probably don't think of \textit{me}
day and night. But I can't even eat from thinking about you!\texttt{"} For my part
I \{say / write\} to her: \texttt{"} Oh, I think of you also day and night, whether
I sleep or whether I sit.[26] But please, let us firmly resolve our hearts[27]
and \{do / make it\} so that we may live together.\texttt{"}

77 Pà-ɛ́: She'll say [things like] \texttt{"}Even if I eat pure white rice,
it is as chaff in my mouth!\texttt{"}[28] \texttt{"}Even if I drink pure water,
it is as though I drank a foul draught.\texttt{"}[28]

78 Cà-lɔ̂: I see.

79 Thû-yì: But some people just say those things with their mouths. In their
hearts they're not in love.

80 Pà-ɛ́: Some people love with their body and soul, completely. Others may
say it with their mouths, but it isn't so.

81 Thû-yì: Well, let's go then! If you're through eating we'll go a-courting!

82 Pà-ɛ́: Let's go.

83 Cà-lɔ̂: What time is it now?[29]

84 Thû-yì: Oh, it's probably about\textit{ a las seis}[30] now.

85 Cà-lɔ̂: The moon hasn't come out yet, has it?

86 Pà-ɛ́: I certainly wouldn't think so, since we're only \textit{a las seis}.
At seven, at seven o' clock.

87 Thû-yì: Well, I don't have a watch,[31] so I don't know anymore. Because my
watch is on the blink,[32] damn it.

88 Pà-ɛ́: Mine is busted, too. But i'm used to it, so I can still tell the time
from it.[33]

89 Cà-lɔ̂: Do the girls have watches on them [too].

90 Thû-yì: Does my girl have a watch? Well, she told me she didn't. When [I found
out] she wanted one I told her I wouldn't be able to buy her one until I could
go to Chiengmai.[34]

91 Cà-lɔ̂: Is that what you said?

92 Thû-yì: I've been planning to buy her one the next time I go to Chiengmai.[35]
I \{wonder / don't know\} how much I'll have to pay--for a little tiny watch like
this.

93 Pà-ɛ́: I'll bet you can get one for two or three hundred [baht].

94 Thû-yì: I can. For two or three hundred.

95 Pà-ɛ́: If the machinery [inside] isn't very good. If the works are fairly
good....[36]

96 Cà-lɔ̂: A woman's watch, eh?--Say, why don't you go court a Thai girl? Haven't
you ever done it?

97 Thû-yì: A Thai? Oh, once I did court a Thai, a while ago.

98 Cà-lɔ̂: Aha! Tell me about it, won't you? Tell me all about how it went.[37]

99 Thû-yì: About that? Well, the Thai now,[38] they have a custom that you can
only court inside the house. That doesn't suit me at all.[39] They can't get together
and go out into the woods like us Lahu.

100 Pà-ɛ́: Those Thais, they'll love whoever goes to them--really!

101 Thû-yì: Sometimes[40] even, while we're visiting them all nice and proper,
some other guy comes too, and she talks to \textit{him} at the same time--that
really gets us mad!

102 Pà-ɛ́: Then we feel like clenching our firsts and having a fight!

103 Thû-yì: That's right. [That's why] the Thais are [always] fighting with each
other.

104 Cà-lɔ̂: You say They're fickle, the Thai girls?

105 Thû-yì: Very fickle, the Thai race.

106 Cà-lɔ̂: You say you can't lead them out into the woods?

107 Thû-yì: You can't go [there].

108 Cà-lɔ̂: What would happen if you \textit{did} take her into the \{woods
/ jungle\}?

109 Thû-yì: They say that that isn't their custom! They say [you've got to] stay
(visiting) in the house, and have your conversation [there]. But we Lahu have no
experience doing it in the house, so we don't dare to!

110 Pà-ɛ́: Well,\textit{ I} dare to.

111 Thû-yì: I'm embarrassed in front of the parents.

112 Pà-ɛ́: The parents ought to help us too, for their part.

113 Cà-lɔ̂: Really?

114 Pà-ɛ́: The parents ought to help us too, for their part. Once we've gone
[to visit].

115 Thû-yì: But they use up a lot of cigarettes[41]!

115 Cà-lɔ̂: \texttt{<}laughs\texttt{>}

116 Pà-ɛ́: Oh, you don't have to tell me about that cigarette business![42]

117 Thû-yì: Whenever we \{get / earn\} a little [spending money] from picking
tea, we just have to spend it all on that!

118 Cà-lɔ̂: \texttt{<}laughing\texttt{>} Each time you go courting a girl how
many packs do you use up--of [those] big gold flakes[43]?

119 Thû-yì: Well, I use up a pack of the big gold flakes every night.

120 Cà-lɔ̂: Do the girls smoke, too?

121 Thû-yì: Some of them smoke and some don't.

122 Pà-ɛ́: Even if they don't smoke, if we offer[44] one they'll smoke it.[45]

123 Thû-yì: Even if she doesn't smoke, there's nothing she can do [to avoid it].
If \textit{we} smoke, then she has to smoke, too. We've got to harmonize with each
other, \{completely / identically\}.

124 Càbo: Do you tell her \texttt{"}If you don't smoke you don't love me\texttt{"}?

125 Thû-yì: Right you are.

126 Pà-ɛ́: The time those three of us went to Ta-ton[46] it was just like that.
Even though the girl[47] had never smoked, we insisted that she smoke the tobacco
we offered her, and she got dizzy as hell from it. And we had to put out for a
whole package of candy [to console her]--candy!
