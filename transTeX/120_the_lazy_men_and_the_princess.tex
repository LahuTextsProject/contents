120 The Lazy Men and the Princess

(Told by Headman Cà-bí)

1. Well, my brethren, once upon a time, as our ancestors---er, let us discuss and
recount to each otehr the story of the four lazy men, shall we?

2. Listen up well!

3. Once upon a time, there was a lazy fellow who went around \{trading/buying and
selling things\}.

4. Since he was very lazy, he went along until he came to a place where four roads
met, and sat himself down there.

5. He sat down there by the roadside waiting for people to come, and after a long
time another lazy guy appeared, right there, at the crossroads.

6. When the two of them met, they asked questions of each other, and kept on waiting
over there.

7. While they were still waiting, another person appeared!

8. Now \{there were/it reached\} three people there waiting.

9. They still kept on waiting, all of them there.

10. Since they were so lazy they just waited by the minute.

11. Then---another guy appeared. There were now four of them.

12. So they all talked to each other, and discussed things with each other.

13. ``So, what can you do, sir?\footnote{\textit{mɔ́ ò }[vocative]: ``O teacher.''}'' [somebody] said.

14. ``Well, I can \{tell fortunes/predict the future\},'' he said.

15. ``And you, what can \textit{you} do?''

16. ``I know how to make crossbows,'' he said.

17. ``I can make crossbows.''

18. ``What can \textit{you} do?''

19. ``I know how to swim,'' he said.

20. Well, while they were all \{discussing these things/talking this way\}, one
of them asked [the fortune-teller], ``What is going to happen?''

21. ``\{Pretty soon/In a short while\}, around nightfall, the daughter of the ruler
of that city there, the \{daughter of the king/princess\}, will pass above us having
been \{bitten and lifted up by/lifted up in the beak of\} \{a hawk/an eagle\}.

22. ``You make a crossbow carefully!'' he said.

23. They were staying near a lake, these guys.

24. The crossroads they were at was near a big lake.

25. Then, after he had finished making the crossbow, that princess who had been
\{bitten by/carried in the beak of\} the great eagle passed above them.

26. He cocked his crossbow and shot it off, and [the eagle] fell down with a big
splash, into the lake.

27. When it had fallen in, [the \{swimmer/guy who could swim\}] swam out and got
her, that child---she was a beautiful maiden, they say.

28. So these three guys argued with each other: ``I got her!'' ``No, I got her!''
they said.

29. After they had \{gotten/retrieved\} the girl, they \{debated/quarreled/argued\}
with each other as if in a court of law, those three guys.

30. What should be done?---when they went to the great place, the great and mighty
lords' place, they were all arguing and quarreling with each other.

31. Which person would win?

32. ``Me, me, I win because I predicted the future!'' he said.

33. Thus they fought with \footnote{\textit{g̈ɔ̀ dàʔ ve}: lit. ``pulled against each other.''} each other.

34. ``I made the crossbow, and got him [the eagle] with a shot,'' he said.

34-A. ``Yeah, I made the crossbow and shot it.''

35. ``I got her by swimming,'' he said.

36. The three of them argued with each other.

37. Arguing and arguing, they arrived at the palace and said, ``Which person won?''

38. ``She was recovered by swimming, so the swimmer, the last person, is the winner,''
so they said.
