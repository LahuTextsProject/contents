113 Let us Dedicate our Precious Lives to the Lord (religious song)

\. With deep respects, since a great personage has bidden us to do it, though we
only know a little, we will just sing what little we know.

\. So now we'll try singing one. [A song] for two girls.

Song:

\. The precious blessing that we are alive at this moment

\. it is a priceless life

\. for all the time that we live our life

\. let us make it be for the Lord Redeemer's sake!

\. Amen.
