\textbf{119 A Lahu Gives a Shan a Good Cursing}

1 Well then, once there was a certain person.

2 As he was on his way to work (1) he met a Shan [woman].

3 When he met the Shan, (2) he had many people with him.(3)

4 Well, he wanted to say to the Shan ``I'm very hungry, very hungry!``

5 [But] what he said was, ``Madam, my stomach is very full!`` (4)

6 So then the Shan [lady] said, ``Since your stomach is full, why don't
you7 lie down here for a while?`` (5), and she got a pillow and put it
down for him.

7 Well, he kept thinking that he would get something to eat, so he went on waiting.(6)

8 He waited and waited for a long time, [but] he still wasn't getting anything
to eat.

9 When [he saw] he was being treated this way,  he got angry.

10 When he got angry, he decided he would curse out the Shan [woman], and said
``Hey, boys, boys (7)! You hustle on ahead.(8)

11 I'm just going to tell this Shan off (9) first!``

12 Then, after the boys had left, he said: ``You damned Lahu! I eat your
shit, sir!`` (10)

<laughter>

13 Then he went off.

14 When he reached his destination,(11) when he saw his people, he said, ``I
really told that Shan a thing or two!`` (17)
