\textbf{119 A Lahu Gives a Shan a Good Cursing}

[Tape X, Side 2]

1 Well, once there was a certain man. 2 He met a1--er, as he was on his way to
work,2 he met a Shan [woman]. 3 When he met the Shan,3 he had many people with
him.4 4 Well, he wanted5 to say to the Shan \texttt{"}I'm very hungry, very hungry!\texttt{"}
5 [But] what he said was, \texttt{"}Madam, my stomach is very full!\texttt{"}6

6 So then the Shan [lady] said, \texttt{"}Since your stomach is full, why don't
you7 lie down here for a while7?,\texttt{"} and she got a pillow and put it down
for him. 7 Well, he kept thinking that he would get something to eat, so he went
on waiting.8 8 He waited and waited, [but] he still wasn't getting anything to
eat.9 9 When [he saw] he was being treated this way,10 he got angry.

10 When he got angry, he decided he would curse out the Shan [woman], and said
\texttt{"}Hey, boys, boys12! You run along ahead.13 11 I'm just going to tell this
Shan off14 first!\texttt{"}

12 Then, after the boys had left, he said: \texttt{"}You damned Lahu! I eat your
shit, sir!\texttt{"}15

[laughter]

13 Then he went off. 14 When he reached his destination,16 when he saw his people,
he said, \texttt{"}I really told that Shan a thing or two!\texttt{"}17
