\textbf{200 Marriage Prayer}

1 Oh ho! today the sun and the moon form a pair, but these two, Mr. Black and Miss
White \footnote{\textbf{Cà-nâʔ} (Mr. Black) and \textbf{Na-phu }(Miss White) are common Lahu personal names. They generally refer to the color of the person's complexion. Mr. Black would be a man of dark skin while Miss White would have a rather light brown complexion.} are not one pair, and so we elders and young people take these two and
make them one pair.

2 The sun and the moon are one pair, these two are not one pair, so here in this
place this evening we of this community, all of us, take Mr. Black and Miss White
and make them one pair.

3 Oh, let them enjoy good and carefree health, and when they have children may
their birth be easy, \footnote{The expression \textbf{yâ ye ve} can mean either 'bear children easily' or 'bear strong children who do not die'.} may they be as plentiful as the fruit of the tÁw-ma tree
