1. I'll just sing a song for you now.

2. Please listen well!

\textit{Song \#1}

3. Oh, I've reached the banks of a beautiful lake,

4. And I can see the dwelling place I love

5. Where rays of sun and little flowers meet.

6. I am still all, all alone.

[7 That's it.]

\textit{Song \#2}

8. Even if you go live far away, please do not forget me!

9. My dear, even if you should find a friend elsewhere, may God's grace be upon
you until we meet again!

10. My beloved friend, my dear!
