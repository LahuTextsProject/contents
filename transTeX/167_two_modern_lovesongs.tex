167 Two modern love songs

1 I'll sing you a song now.

2 Listen well!

Song \#1

3 Oh, I've reached the banks of a beautiful lake,

4 And I can see my beloved dwelling

5 In a place where rays of sun and little flowers meet

6 I am still all, all alone.

7 That's it.

Song \#2

8 Even if you go live far away, please do not forget me!

9 My dear, even if you should find a friend elsewhere, may God's grace be upon
you until we meet again!

10 My beloved friend, my dear!
