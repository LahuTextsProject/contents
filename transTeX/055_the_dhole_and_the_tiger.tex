{\Large{}\textbf{55 The Dhole and the Tiger}}

{\Large{}[Tape IV, \#42]}

{\Large{}1. Now I shall tell you a story. Listen to it with attention, my Lahu
brethren!}

{\Large{}2. Once upon a time a tiger and a dhole [1] were talking together.}

{\Large{}3. The tiger said, ``There is no one who is cleverer or stronger
than me!``}

{\Large{}4. ``Do you really think you're so clever?`` said the
dhole. ``You're not, you know. There is somebody who is even greater than
you.`` }

{\Large{}5. ``Who is it?`` said the big tiger. ``Are there
still those things called humans around?`` }

{\Large{}6. ``There are indeed! There are lots of them. If you would like
to test your cleverness against them, I'll show you where they are.`` }

{\Large{}7. ``Let's go, let's go! Just show me! I'll take a quick bite
out of them and show you how I eat them up,`` he said.}

{\Large{}8. One day, when the tiger saw two girls going to the fields, he said
to the dhole, ``Are they the ones?`` 9. When he asked this, the
dhole, seeing that they had no gun, said ``No.``}

{\Large{}10. Another time, when the tiger spied a man carrying a gun and coming
to the fields, and when he asked the dhole about it, saying, ``Hey, dhole,
is this the one?``, the dhole said ``Yes, yes it is.``
}

{\Large{}11. When the man noticed that the tiger had seen him and was running at
him, he aimed the double-barrelled gun [2] he was carrying and shot a blast of
buckshot from one barrel. }

{\Large{}12. When [the tiger] came at him again, he shot six bullets [3] at him
from the other barrel. }

{\Large{}13. The tiger ran away, and the dhole said to him, ``Wasn't I
telling you the truth?`` }

{\Large{}14. ``Yes! I can't stand up to him. He shot at me--bang, bang!--and
I got bitten and tingly all over, and I just couldn't stand it!`` he told
him. }

{\Large{}15. ``Just so,`` said the dhole.}

{\Large{}16. This story, if each and every one of us thinks it over to himself,
has relevance for us all. }

{\Large{}17. We may think, ``How full of cleverness I am!``, but
it is not so. }

{\Large{}18. There is always someone greater than me! }

{\Large{}19. There are probably some among us Lahu who are still that way [4] up
to the present day, aren't there? }

{\Large{}20. If there are, O my brethren, make haste to repent, please. }

{\Large{}21. Thus am I warning you. Mark my words well. This story is over. }
