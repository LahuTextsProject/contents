102 The Stupid Son-in-law Beats a Benevolent Bonze

1. Once upon a time there was a certain person.

2. He used to go and set traps for animals.

3. One day when he was setting traps, an old Buddhist monk \footnote{phàʔ-tū-mɔ̂: 1st syllable \texttt{<} Tai (cf. Si. \textbf{phrÁʔ} `lord;} who had gone there
to pick sticky berries \footnote{qhɔ-mêʔ-šī: lit. ``mountain eye'', I kind of sticky tart whitish berry.} to eat caught sight of a barking deer \footnote{chɨ-kɛ-mɛ, lit. ``dwarf deer.'' This name for the barking deer is especially} that had been
trapped \.\footnote{This sentence was somewhat garbled by the speaker: phàʔ-tū-mɔ̂ tê g̈â}

4. When he saw the trapped barking deer, he set it free.

5. After this, he [the trap-setter] went home.

6. When he got home he said to his father-in-law, ``Granddad \footnote{ɔ̀-pū (voc. à-pū) means either `grandfather' or `father-in-law', according}, we must have
trapped somebody else's calf!'' \footnote{The stupid guy is making two mistakes: (a) he takes the barking deer for a}

7. So then he went off again [to set traps].

8. Once again he trapped a barking deer.

9. And again it was set free.

10. ``Granddad, I just keep trapping somebody else's calf, and it's been set free!'',
he said.

11a. This time the father-in-law said, ``Granddad \footnote{Here the father-in-law uses the kin term as a 1p pronoun.} tells you [to say], `No matter
what it is, it's my grand-dad's kitty-cat!'''\footnote{The father-in-law, realizing that his son-in-law is not the sharpest knife}

11b. ``Hurry and bring it [home]!'', he said.

12. So the next time that the senior monk went to pick sticky berries to eat, he
was waiting for him.

13. So when he saw him, he cut down a cudgel [from a tree] and beat him with it.

14. While he was beating him, [the monk] said ``\textbf{khɔ́ tə̄, khɔ́ tə̄}!''\footnote{Shan or N. Thai \textbf{khɔ́ }`beg, supplicate'; \textbf{tə̄} is\textbf{}

15. ``\textbf{Khɔ́ tə̄} or no \textbf{Khɔ́ tə̄},\textbf{ }it's my old man's
kitty-cat!'' he said. \footnote{The son-in-law treats the foreign phrase \textbf{khɔ́ tə̄ }as a verb compound,}
