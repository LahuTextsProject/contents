{\Large{}\textbf{\#102 The Stupid Son-in-law and the Bonze}}

{\Large{}1. Once upon a time there was a certain stupid person.}

{\Large{}2. He used to go and set traps for animals.}

{\Large{}3. One day when he was setting traps, an old Buddhist monk [1] who had
gone there to pick     }

{\Large{}sticky berries [2] to eat caught sight of a barking deer [3] that had
been trapped.}

{\Large{}4. When he saw the trapped barking deer, he set it free.}

{\Large{}5. After this, he [the trap-setter] went home.}

{\Large{}6. When he got home he said to his father-in-law, ``Granddad [4], we must
have trapped     }

{\Large{}somebody else's calf!'' [5]}

{\Large{}7. So then he went back again [to set traps].}

{\Large{}8. Once again he trapped a barking deer.}

{\Large{}9. And again it was set free.}

{\Large{}10. ``Granddad, I just keep trapping somebody else's calf, and it's been
set free!'', he said.}

{\Large{}11a. This time the father-in-law said, ``Granddad [6] tells you [to say],
`Whatever it is,        }

{\Large{}it's my grand-dad's pussy-cat!'''[7]}

{\Large{}11b. ``Hurry and bring it [home]!'', he said.}

{\Large{}12. So the stupid guy went back again, and when that senior monk was picking
sticky berries to       }

{\Large{}eat, this time he was waiting for him.}

{\Large{}13. So when he saw him, he cut down a cudgel [from a tree] and beat him
with it.}

{\Large{}14. While he was beating him, [the monk] said ``}{\Large{}\textbf{khɔ́
tə̄, khɔ́ tə̄}}{\Large{}!''[8]}

{\Large{}15. ``}{\Large{}\textbf{Khɔ́ tə̄}}{\Large{} or no }{\Large{}\textbf{Khɔ́
tə̄}}{\Large{},}{\Large{}\textbf{ }}{\Large{}it's my old man's kitty-cat!'' he
said. [9]}
