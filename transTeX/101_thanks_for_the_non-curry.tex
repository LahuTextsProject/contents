{\Large{}\textbf{101 Thanks for the non-curry }}

{\Large{}[Tape X, Side 1]}

{\Large{}1 Once there was a certain man.}

{\Large{}2 He went off to clear land for a road.[1]}

{\Large{}3 Since they were making [people] go clear land for a road.}

{\Large{}4 He worked and worked on the road, and when the time came to go back
home, he was very hungry.}

{\Large{}5 Since he was very hungry, he went to beg something to eat from a Shan.}

{\Large{}6 So he said to the Shan: ``Madam, [2] Wouldn't you have some
cooked rice?`` [3]}

{\Large{}7 The Shan said, ``I have, I have. }

{\Large{}8 I don't have any curry [4] to go with it, though.``[5]}

{\Large{}9 So he said, ``Even if there's nothing to eat with it, I'll eat
it.`` [6]}

{\Large{}10 So the Shan [lady] ground up some peppers [7] and gave them to him
to eat.}

{\Large{}11 When she had ground them up and fed them to him, he ate and was about
to leave. [8]}

{\Large{}12 As he was about to leave, the Shan said: ``[Sorry] you didn't
even get any curry to eat.`` }

{\Large{}13 At this he [tried to] make [polite] conversation with the Shan. [9]}

{\Large{}14 ``Though I didn't get to }{\Large{}\textit{eat}}{\Large{} any
curry, it was still delicious! May madam feast on my      }

{\Large{}gratitude!``, he said.[10] }
