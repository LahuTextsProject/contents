\textbf{107c A Black Lahu Rolls up his Pants to Have a Smoke }

1 There were two men.1 2 The two of them were going together along a road. 3 [The
Yellow Lahu] said to the Black Lahu, "When we get up there on the mountain,
let's roll ourselves some tobacco and \{have a smoke / smoke for a while\}."2
[4 Then the Black Lahu said, "Well, here we are at the top--so let me
roll up my pants!"] [4 Then, when they got up there, the Black Lahu said,
"Let me roll up [the cuff of] my pants!"

5 "What are you doing?" he asked.

6 "Didn't yo just say you were going to tie me up?" he said.3

The B. L. purposely (?) misinterprets 'kə-chɨ̂ʔ' as the B.L. phɛ-chɨ̀ʔ
'tie up,' then farther puns on the phɛ (not used in Y. L. in this compound) equating
it with phɛ̂ʔ part and you do the chɨ̀ʔ part."
