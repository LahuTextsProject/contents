1 Cà-vàʔ: Have you gone swimming in the river yet?

2 Cà-g̈âʔ: I haven't swum yet.

3 Paul: Speak a little louder!

4 Cà-vàʔ: Where are you going today?

5 Cà-g̈âʔ: I'm not going any place.

6 Paul: I'm certainly not going anywhere.

7 Cà-vàʔ: For my part, I want to go to the opium field!

8 Paul: Who are you going with? Hurry up and say it, Cà-vàʔ.

9 Cà-vàʔ: I'm going with you!

10 Paul: Before this I never even got to go with you.

11 Cà-vàʔ: We're off to cultivate the opium field.

12 Cà-g̈âʔ: Where is it anyway?

13 Cà-vàʔ: It's at Na-li.

14 Cà-g̈âʔ: Have you finished cultivating it yet?

15 Cà-vàʔ: There's a little we still haven't finished.

16 Cà-g̈âʔ: How much still is left?

17 Cà-vàʔ: There's just a little left still! By tomorrow we'll have cultivated
enough.

18 Cà-g̈âʔ: So tomorrow you'll have it all done!

19 Cà-vàʔ: It'll be done. Tomorrow.

20 Cà-g̈âʔ: I'll be able to help you tomorrow too. Together with some of you.

21 Cà-vàʔ: Do help!

22 Cà-g̈âʔ: All this staying at home for one or two months, I got tired of
working in the swidden.

23 Cà-vàʔ: So come and help! Come help me cultivate tomorrow, just with me.

24 Paul: Hey Crocodile,\footnote{Paul is evidently calling Cà-g̈âʔ by this nickname.} tomorrow are you going to help along with me then?

25 Cà-g̈âʔ: I will help you a little bit, Crocodile! ... I've been such a lazybones
this year.

26 Paul: So if we're going to help I'll help, me too.
