The Trickster and the Village Women

I

(1) Once upon a time the Lahu were fighting a war with the Chinese.[1] (2) Well,
on a certain morning, the morning for going off to war, people were selected[2]
and they went off. (3) [But] while others had made rice-packets[3] for themselves,
this fellow \textit{ɛ̀-qhɛ}̀[4] had wrapped up a sparse-feathered little chicken[5]
to take with him, and on the road, when they ate, when it was time to eat, he unwrapped
it and made as if to eat his meal. (4) As he unwrapped it and the little chick
hopped right out, he said, 徹h, dear, I mustn稚 go [with you]! You all go [on
ahead without me]! As for me, since I致e seen this omen,[6] I'm going home. I
can't possibly fight a war now. See you guys later!''[7] (5) And so the others
let him go back.

(6) Then, when they had let him go back, he ripped open a bumblebee's nest, scooped
out some crabs, and tied them so they dangled from a bamboo-sheath, placed this
[all] outside the house [of a certain woman]. (7) Then when night fell, and [the
bees went] bzz-bzz-bzz and [the crab] went scratching \textit{teh-tehagainst the
bamboo-tube―er, bamboo-sheath, Trickster said to the woman, ``Aha, the spirits
of your husbands have come back to you! Don't stay here any more! It's too scary!''}

(8) So they all went trooping over to the Trickster's house to sleep.

(9) Then that Trickster said, ``Oh, come now, don't sleep at my house. Your kids
will shit all over everything.'' (10) So then they swore to him, saying, ``Oh,
no, we won't let them shit. We guarantee it!,'' and they were allowed to sleep
at Trickster's house. (11) Then, after the bunch of women fell asleep, the Trickster
thoroughly mashed up some shitbeans, squeezed [the paste] into balls, and smeared
it on the rear ends of all the children who were there.

(12) When dan broke he said, ``Just look at the way your kids have crapped up my
whole house! What will you give me as compensation?,'' and they said, ``Oh, any
compensation at all! Whatever you want to take, take!,'' but when they offered
him money he wouldn't take it. (13) No matter what they offered, he wouldn't take
it.

(14) Then the Trickster said to the bunch of women, ``Well, go and beat on the
Hollow A-yaw Tree, and listen [to what it tells you].'' (15) In order to go beat
on that Hollow A-yaw Tree-oracle, he made the women take the long way around. (16)
The Trickster himself went by the straight road, and got inside of the Hollow A-yaw,
and the women tried beating on the outside, going \textit{thump-thump, saying,
``What sort of compensation shall we give to Trickster?'' (17) And the Trickster
said, ``Ah, give him compensation, give him compensation!'' (18) So they went back
home again. (19) The Trickster also ran back after the women as fast as he could,
[so he was] sitting in his house [when they got there], and said, ``Well, what
did it say to you?,'' and they said, ``Well, all it said was, `Give compensation
to Trickster!'''}

IV-b

(20) ``Well, then,'' he said, ``unless you beat on it once more, you won't know
[what to do],'' so again they [went to] beat on it and ask it [a question]―the
Trickster had quickly gotten inside of it again―and the women in a body beat
on it,\textit{ thump-thump, and it said, ``Oh, give him cunt, give him cunt!''}

(21) At this the bunch of women ran back home, and the Trickster also rand back
fast, and sitting in his house working this time with strips of rattan he said,
``Well, what did it say? What did it tell you?'' and they said, ``Well, Trickster―it
just said, `Give him cunt, give him cunt!'''

(22) Whereupon Trickster proceeded to fuck every single woman in the village, one
after the other.

(23) Well, when all their husbands came back [from the war], they said, ``Oh, Trickster
did this and that to us! After you all were gone, Trickster fucked us!,'' so straightaway,
as soon as all the husbands were back, they chased after Trickster trying to kill
him, and he ran away. (24) He ran away and they chased him, but they couldn't catch
him. (25) No matter how they chased him they couldn't catch him. (26) Unsuccessful
once again, they came back home, while this Trickster, this guy, he scooped out
some honey and smeared himself with it, and then he went and lay down inside a
storage basket in a cotton-house, then when they saw him in the joss-stick temple
they said, ``Oh, the god has appeared to us today!'' (27) So they made offerings
to him. (28) When they gave him the food he ate it. (29) When he did this, they
thought ``It's only the Trickster!,'' realizing it all of a sudden, so they grabbed
him and tried to beat him to death, but again he ran away.

(30) Again they chased him, and oh, this time they were chasing and chasing him,
he pulled out his penis and skinned back his foreskin, and scratched together some
leaves to cover himself, and made his penis all stiff and straight, and they said,
``Well, Trickster's trail has petered out now! And here's a red Phalloides mushroom
that has sprouted.'' (31) After this they went home.

(32) After they went home, the Trickster went back again too, and this time when
they were chasing him, this guy, this Trickster, he managed to climb up into a
big clump of trees. (33) When he had gotten to the top of a big tree, at that point,
as they chopped away at it, trying to get it to fall into the river down below,
he said, ``Oh, in my position, if you would only chop so that I fall into the water
down there, I'd be able to swim back out and I wouldn't die. [But] if you chop
me so I land on that rocky cliff up there, I'd surely be smashed to smithereens!
I would die!,'' and so they chopped it in such a way that its fall was broken by
the cliff up there, and he managed to escape into a cave in the rocks.

(34) Then, when the Trickster had gone into the cave up there, the others blew
smoke inside with all their might. (35) But try as they would, they couldn't get
it to blow inside. (36) He had taken off his shirt and was fanning it out again―from
where he was, inside there. [(37) After this, they made a falling-log trap for
him to get caught in.] (38) They poked in sticks―they hacked off some sticks
and poked them inside. (39) So the Trickster took a shit and smeared it on the
sticks, and it sta-a-nk like hell, and they said, ``Aha, the Trickster's shit is
coming out of him now! He's dead!,'' and they set a falling-log trap and went back
home.

(40) After this, the Trickster took up his jewsharp―his jawharp, and blew on
it with gusto, and early the next morning two young girls came to have a look,
and when they heard the sound of the Trickster playing the jawharp, they said,
``Yoo-hoo, Trickster, please let the two of us come in!'' (41) Then he said, ``Well,
then, let the one who is truly uglier come in first,'' and when the one who was
truly uglier came in first, she was crushed to death. (42) Thereupon the Trickster
managed to escape outside once more.

(43) Then, again they chased and chased him, and [this time] they caught him. (44)
When they caught him they tied him to the ass of a water-buffalo, and dragged them
along. (45) Then they bent his face over downwards and dragged him over a piece
of rocky ground, and he said ``A-lo, a-lo, a-lo!'' (46) Then they dragged him over
some grassy ground―uh, they drove him and dragged him along over some grassy
ground, and he said ``A-lo, a-lo, a-lo!'' (47) And when they dragged him [again]
over the rocks they said, ``Serves you right, serves you right, serves you right!''
(48) [But] he didn't die.

(49) Again he managed to get out, and once more they chased after him. (50) Once
they had seized hold of him, they tied him so he hung underneath a big bridge over
the water, some distance away. (51) After they had left him strung up there, at
that point, a large group of traders came along. (52) And they said, ``Hey, Trickster!
What are you doing there under the bridge?,'' and he said―to that bunch of Chinese―``Since
my eyes are sore, my eyes are `imbibing the essence!''' (53) ``Well, we would like
to imbibe it also, Trickster!'' they said, and he said, ``Let me loose then!''
(54) So they let him loose, and he got free.

(55) So the Trickster―now that a group of traders had been driving their mules,
horses, and elephants around to the villages, having come to trade them. (56) Since
they all happened to have sore eyes, he tied them up, and as they were trying to
``imbibe the essence of the water'' under there, under the bridge, he cut them
down so they fell in and died, and Trickster got away with all their goods, their
silver and their gold.

(57) After this he went back, and when he had returned to his home again the said,
``Oh, Trickster, how did you get [all this]? How did it happen that you got so
much silver and gold even though we tried to kill you?,'' and he said, ``Well,
I just got it by `imbibing the essence' of the water! Since it was you all who
did this for me...''

(58) Then they said, ``Oh, we'd like to get it too!,'' so he led them away, making
each man carry with him to that place a pickling-tub as big as a forehead-basket,
and he strung them up there underneath [the bridge], and after the people had gotten
inside [their tubs] they entered the water. (59) Immediately he made them sink
down into the water, and they thrashed around furiously.

(60) Then, since there was one old codger who hadn't gone in, he said to him, ``There,
there, there, look! The others are fighting with each other over the gold!,'' so
he jumped in too, and [Trickster] cut through [the ropes], and after the whole
villageful [of men] had died, he got the women of all the people in the village
for himself.
