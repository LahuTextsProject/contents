{\Large{}\textbf{\#95 The Trickster with the Talented Pecker}}

{\Large{}1. Once upon a time there was a certain person called Eh-Hk'eh (ɛ̀-qhɛ̀).}

{\Large{}2. Day after day he would fish out his pecker [1] and trap insects [2]
with it.}

{\Large{}3. When a fly would come within reach he would cover it up under his clothes
[to trap it]. [3]}

{\Large{}4. Once it happened to be a honeybee.}

{\Large{}5. When the honeybee happened along, he tried to cover it up under his
clothes, and it stung him.}

{\Large{}6. When he got stung, because where he tried to cover it up and where
it stung him was the same place, he cursed it, saying, ``This bee is a wretched
foul bee!'' [4]}

{\Large{}7. So after that he whipped out his pecker again and managed to catch
some insects [with it], then he went and set them free in a place where chickens
were being fed.}

{\Large{}8. Right away the chickens pecked at [the trapped bugs] and nibbled at
them .[5]}

{\Large{}9. When the chickens pecked and nibbled at him he sobbed bitterly, that
guy.}

{\Large{}10. So they gave him one chicken [as compensation].}

{\Large{}11. After he got the chicken he then went to a place where pigs were fed,
and proceeded [6] to let it [the chicken] go free.}

{\Large{}12. So then the pigs bit it to death.}

{\Large{}13. When they bit it to death, he sobbed bitterly.}

{\Large{}14. Since he was sobbing so much, they proceeded to give him a pig---they
[just gave it] to him.}

{\Large{}15. So leading the pig, he went and set it free in somebody's cattle-pen.}

{\Large{}16. When he set it free in there, the cattle kicked it the hell [7] to
death.}

{\Large{}17. So then he sat down there and sobbed with all his might.}

{\Large{}18. Since he was crying [so much] they gave him a cow.}

{\Large{}19. Leading this cow, this time he went and set it free in an elephant
corral.}

{\Large{}20. So then the elephant(s) killed that cow of his.}

{\Large{}21. Whereupon he sat down there and cried his eyes out.}

{\Large{}22. Since he was crying [so much] they finally gave him an elephant.}

{\Large{}23. Then, leading this elephant he went and let it go free in a potter's
workshop.}

{\Large{}24. His elephant stepped on the pots and shattered them. [8]}

{\Large{}25. Since it had trampled his pots to pieces, the other guy [the potter]
\{took/got\} his elephant.}

{\Large{}26. So then he sat down there and wept bitterly.}

{\Large{}27. While he was crying, a bird came and called out to him.}

{\Large{}28. What that bird was calling was }{\Large{}\textbf{kru-g̈âʔ kru-g̈âʔ}}{\Large{}.[9]}

{\Large{}29. So then he let fly with a potsherd, and he got it.}

{\Large{}30. He caught it, plucked it and roasted it, and it was very fat.}

{\Large{}31. Since it was so fat, he smeared the fat onto his pecker.}

{\Large{}32. As soon as he had smeared it on, his pecker began to sing.}

{\Large{}33. It sang }{\Large{}\textbf{kru-g̈âʔ kru-g̈âʔ}}{\Large{}, and
no matter what he did it didn't get better .[10]}

{\Large{}34. But then, when he scorched [his penis] with the [hot] potsherd, he
was cured.}

{\Large{}35. So then he took along some of that bird-fat and went to a place where
a princess was doing some weaving.}

{\Large{}36. Then after he had smeared some of that bird-fat onto her stool [11],
her pussy began to sing.}

{\Large{}37. When her pussy sang, it just sang }{\Large{}\textbf{kru-g̈âʔ kru-g̈âʔ}}{\Large{}.}

{\Large{}38. So then they sought all the physicians in the city to have them cure
her.}

{\Large{}39. [But] no matter who treated her, she did not get better.}

{\Large{}40. Whoever it was who treated her, she was not cured.}

{\Large{}41. Finally they said to ɛ̀-qhɛ̀, ``Oh, if you can cure this woman,
take her for your wife!}

{\Large{}42. ``And furthermore, if you can cure her, you will be given half of
the kingdom,'' they said to him.}

{\Large{}43. So then ɛ̀-qhɛ̀ went and scorched [her] with that hot potsherd,
and she was cured.}

{\Large{}44. She was cured, so he got the princess, and also got control of half
the country.}
