95 Further Adventures of the Trickster (or The Trickster Finds a Novel Way to Catch
Flies and Gains Half a Kingdom)

1. Once upon a time there was a certain person called Eh-Hk'eh (ɛ̀-qhɛ̀).

2. \{Day after day/every day\} he would \{fish/whip\} out his prick \footnote{Since Lahu has only a sing word for the sexual organs (\textbf{ní }`penis', \textbf{cha} `vagina') it is a problem choosing among the myriad English synonyms to find the ones that fit best stylistically in a given context. I here choose `prick' since it has respectable antecedents (e.g., appearing in Shakespeare), although more jocular terms like \textit{wiener} might fit the mood of the story better.} and \{catch/trap\}
insects \footnote{\textbf{pɨ́ }can either mean `insect in general' (the sense here) or more specifically, `mosquito'. It is not clear what aspect of the Trickster's organ was so attractive to insects.} with it.

7. So then, \{after/when\} he whipped out his prick [again] and managed to trap
an insect [with it], he went to a place where chickens were fed, and let them go
free.

8. Right away the chickens pecked at [the trapped bug] and nibbled it .\footnote{The painfulness of this experience for the Trickster is emphasized by \textbf{šē} (Pv) `regretful state of affairs'.}

9. \{While/when\} the chickens picked and nibble [at him] he sobbed bitterly, that
guy.

10. So they gave him one chicken [as compensation].

11. After he got the chicken he then went to a place where pigs were fed, and proceeded
