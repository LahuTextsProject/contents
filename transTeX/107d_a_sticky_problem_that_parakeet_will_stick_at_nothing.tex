\textbf{107d A Sticky Problem (or That Parakeet Will Stick at Nothing)}

1 Then there were two [other] people, once upon a time, named qɔ̀-nɛ́ and qɔ̀-ŋɔ́.1
2 One morning they were going along together, when [one of them] said: 3 "Let's
go parakeet-trapping early tomorrow morning, okay?" 4 So the next morning
they went off together.

5 When they had finished laying the parakeet-traps, a parakeet came and got stuck2
on it--on [the trap] of qɔ̀-nɛ́. 6 Thereupon qɔ̀-ŋɔ́ said, "Friend,
it's stuck3 on yours!" 7 Then, another one got stuck over on [the trap]
of qɔ̀-ŋɔ́. 8 At this, he4 said, "Friend, there's one stuck5 on yours
too!"

9 Then the two of them got furious at each other6 and began fighting. 10 As they
fought, they ended up down in the river--and [all because] he4 had said "The
parakeets aren't paying any attention to yours!"7
