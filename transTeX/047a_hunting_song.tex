47a When we go hunting

0 Now I would like to sing a little song about how we go hunting. Please listen
well.

1 This Saturday is the day for us Lahu to go hunting.

2 The biggest joy for us Lahu is hunting day.

3 Each and every man carries his crossbow and gun, and leading his dogs he goes
into the jungle.

4 No matter how high the mountain, no matter how tall, he goes off in joy and gladness.

5 When he arrives in the jungle the hunter, leading his dogs, diligently chases
after all kinds of rodents, sambar deer, and barking deer.

6 No matter how much strength he has to expend, for him it is a pleasure.

7 Listen, listen! The dogs are making a racket as they chase.\footnote{qha-pâʔ is an intensifying verb particle used in situations where non-visual perception (esp. hearing or not hearing) is at issue.}

8 Let's go, let's go! Yellow Guy, Black Guy!\footnote{These male dogs' names begin with the prefix cà-, while the female dogs' names begin with the prefix na-. Cf. ši `yellow' and nâʔ `black'.} Let's go, let's go! Goldie, Blackie!
Let's go, let's go!

9 O hunters, the dogs are making a lot of noise, let's keep our eyes peeled!
