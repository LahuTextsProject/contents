\textbf{110 The 'Empty Coconuts': the Lahu and the Shan Traders}

1 Once upon a time there was a certain man.

2 One day, leading a group of young people, he went along a road.

3 As they were going along the road, they arrived at a certain place, where they
saw a group of important-looking (1) Shan traders.

4 Well, there were very many of these important traders.

5 When he saw them, he said--he asked the Shans [a question].

6 What he said was, `` ``pɔ-lè, šahÁy, šú hàʔ šÁ ɛ̀?``

7 Which means ``Sirs, friends, what are you carrying [with you]?``

8 At this a Shan said, ``ma hàʔ šÁn. hàʔ pāu lÁj-lÁj ə̀.``

9 So then he asked again: ``pɔ-lè, hàʔ šÁ ɛ̀?``

10 That is, ``Sir, what are you carrying?

11 Then the Shan answered him again, ``ma hàʔ šÁ. hàʔ pāu lÁj-lÁj
ə̀.``

12 That is, the Shan was saying ``We're not carrying anything.

13 Our saddlebags are all empty.``

14 Then he said to the boys: ``Hey, boys, boys! They say they're carrying
coconuts2!

15 Wouldn't you like to eat some?

16 If you'd like to eat some coconuts, why don't you all chip in some money (3)!``

17 So he collected some money.

18 When they got the money together, they said to the Shans, ``Please sell
us some coconuts!``

19 At this the Shan said, ``We have nothing to sell.

20 ``pāu lÁj-lÁj ə̀!``

21 That is, ``Our saddlebags are empty4!``
