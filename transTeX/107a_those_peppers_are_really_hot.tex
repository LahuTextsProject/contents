{\LARGE{}\textbf{\#107a Those Peppers are Really Hot!}}

{\LARGE{}<told in Yellow Lahu>}

{\LARGE{}1 Once upon a time there were two men. [1]}

{\LARGE{}2 [This story is about how] one day the two of them picked some greens
}

{\LARGE{}to boil up for a curry.}

{\LARGE{}3 They got up to the fields, and when noontime came the two of them
}

{\LARGE{}were looking for [something to] boil up and eat [2] for a curry.}

{\LARGE{}4 So the Yellow Lahu said to the Black Lahu, ``Why don't we go boil
}

{\LARGE{}up some cabbages?''}

{\LARGE{}5 After a while they went and boiled the cabbage.}

{\LARGE{}6 They cooked it, and it came to a boil.[3]}

{\LARGE{}7 After it was done, when he [4] had mixed up some salt and hot    }

{\LARGE{}peppers [in a dish], he said ``Scoop out a little, will you, pal?''}

{\LARGE{}8 Then, after a few seconds [5] he repeated, ``Scoop out a little salt,
}

{\LARGE{}will you, pal?''}

{\LARGE{}9 Now the way the Black Lahu said [it was because] he didn't know    }

{\LARGE{}the Yellow Lahu dialect.}

{\LARGE{}10 So that he [ended up] making the Yellow Lahu scoop out     }

{\LARGE{}some }{\LARGE{}\textit{cabbage }}{\LARGE{}[instead of the spice mixture].}

{\LARGE{}11 Well, it was burning hot, and the Yellow Lahu jumped up and ran away.}
