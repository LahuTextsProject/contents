107a Those Peppers are Really Hot!

1 Once upon a time there were two men.

2 [This story is about how] one day the two of them picked some greens to boil
up for a curry.

3 They got up to the fields, and when noontime came the two of them were looking
for [something to] boil up for a curry.

4 So the Yellow Lahu said to the Black Lahu, ``Why don't we go boil up some cabbages?''

5 After a while they went and boiled the cabbage.

6 They cooked it, and it came to a boil.\footnote{cÁ is a transitive verb, `to cook by boiling'. bî is an intransitive verb.}

7 After it was done, when he\footnote{I.e., the Black Lahu.} had mixed up some salt and hot peppers [in a dish],
he said ``Scoop out a little, will you, pal?''

8 Then, after a few seconds\footnote{Apparently the Yellow Lahu hadn't understood at all the first time.} he repeated, ``Scoop out a little salt, will you,
pal?''

9 Now the way the Black Lahu said [it was because] he didn't understand the Yellow
Lahu dialect.

10 So that he [ended up] making the Yellow Lahu scoop out some \textit{cabbage}.

11 Well, it was burning hot, and the Yellow Lahu jumped --- er, the Yellow Lahu
ran away [in pain].
