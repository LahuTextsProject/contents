\textbf{103 The Ferocious Elephant }

[Tape X, Side 1]

1 Once upon a time there was a certain man.[1]

2 He saw someone[2]

taking care of a grazing elephant[3]someplace,[4] [and said] ``Friend,
is your elephant dangerous--is he dangerous?``[5]

3 ``Sure he's an elephant! Sure he's an elephant!``[5]

4 ``Is your elephant dangerous? Is he dangerous, friend?``[5]

5 ``Sure he's an elephant! Sure he's an elephant!``[5]

6 ``Boys,[6] he says it's dangerous. Let's run!`` he said.7 ``Vamoose,
vamoose!``[7]

7 ``Where are you going?``[5] [said the Shan].

8 ``Vamoose, vamoose!``[6]

[Another Lahu tries to explain the story we've just heard:]

1 What he was saying just now, see, [was this]: ``s\textit{a}-hai``
means ``friend.`` 2 Then ``sÁ can nɛ̀ʔ cà tɛ̀ hâ[8]
means ``In your elephant dangerous (cà)?`` 3. But to the Shan,
``cà(n) meant ``elephant.`` 4 So it was as if he'd said
``[In your elephant on] elephant`` to the Shan.

5 So then, he was very frightened and ran away and reached a thorn-tree which he
climbed up. 6 Once he got up to the top of the thorn-tree, he couldn't manage to
get down again. 7. So somebody had to put a ladder against[9] [the tree] and take
him [down].[10]
