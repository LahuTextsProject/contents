109 The hornbills are munching hog-plums, but I'd rather catch fish

1 Once there were two guys, one was named Crazy Man\footnote{Cà-g̈û: cà- `prefix to male names', g̈û `be crazy'.} and the other was named
Weasel.\footnote{fɨ́-lâ-qō: glossed variously as `golden marten; yellow-throated marten' or `yellow weasel.' See DL:1314.}

2 The two of them\footnote{yɔ̂ nî g̈â: this is a colloquial variant of yɔ̂-hɨ nî g̈â, which is possible to use when the plurality is clear from the context, in this case the numeral + classifier nî g̈â.} were clearing a swidden when one [Crazy Man] said to the
other, ``There are hornbills, lots of them, munching on hog-plums.''\footnote{màʔ-chu-šī: Spondias pinnata, a tree with edible bark and fruits. See DL:980.}

3 Weasel: ``Whereabouts?''

4 Crazy Man: ``Down there, in the plains, on the banks of the Kok River.''

5 Weasel: ``You crazy piece of trash, nobody has each heard of such a thing, hornbills
like that!''

6 Crazy Man: ``It's true! It's true that there are hornbills munching hog-plums.''

7 Weasel: ``Nobody has ever said such a thing!''

8 Crazy Man: ``I'm going to take my musket and go shoot them and come back. There
are lots and lots of them!''

9 Weasel: ``Nobody will go with you. You're lying. You're nuts!''

10 Crazy Man [talking to somebody else]: ``Grandpa, grandpa,\footnote{lɔ̂-pū: (1) old man (2) jocular form of address to any man. See DL:1400.} there are hornbills
munching on the hog-plums. Come and shoot them, come shoot, come shoot, come shoot!
The hornbills are munching the hog-plums.''

11 Old man: ``Where, where? I don't see them!''

12 Crazy Man: ``Over there, in the jungle.''

13 Crazy Man: ``Let's go! I'm going to catch fish with a bell-net.\footnote{ŋâ phɛ̂ ve (OV)} Down there
in the Kok River.''

14 ``Let's go, let's go, let's go, we're heading out!''

15 ``Wow, these fish are really making noise splashing around tonight!''

16 ``You're lying! I don't hear anything.''

17 ``It's making noise like a helicopter!''

18 ``Yes. As they're flying, they landed where the net bird-trap\footnote{A net set up in a narrow mountain pass, so that when a bird hits it, it rolls up and entraps the bird.} is.''

19 ``I still can't hear --- those fish in the water. I can't see them.''

20 ``Yes! I'm going to scoop them out. I'm going to release my net right away.
Like I did once before, I'm going to get a whole shoulder bag full, my pants\footnote{If a fisherman runs out of receptacles he might take off his trousers and stuff them full of fish, tying the ends to make a bundle.}
full, my rucksack full!''

21 ``Hmm. I didn't see that you shared them with me that time!''

22 ``I was out doing it so late at night down there in the plains before I came
back home here again.''
