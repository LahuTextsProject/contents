{\Large{}\textbf{82a The Smoker and the Non-Smoker    }}

{\Large{}<told by Headman Ca-bi>}

{\Large{}1. Well, once upon a time there were two men.}

{\Large{}2. One of them was a tobacco-smoker, he used to smoke all the time. He
was a     }

{\Large{}great smoker.}

{\Large{}3. The other one didn't smoke.}

{\Large{}4. His pipe --- the smoker's pipe was a very fine one.}

{\Large{}5. The inside [1] of it was red and smooth, and it was streamlined and
shiny, so that     }

{\Large{}the non- smoker wanted to have it, and stole it away from him.}

{\Large{}6. When he had gone and stolen it, the two of them then made a big court
case out of it.}

{\Large{}7. They made a big case of it, they were fighting with each other before
major and     }

{\Large{}minor officials, and finally they reached the king --- and this king was
a very shrewd man.}

{\Large{}8. He ordered the non-smoker to make a wad of tobacco to put in the pipe.}

{\Large{}9. And he had the real smoker crumple [2] some tobacco too.}

{\Large{}10. ``Both of you crumple it and put it down here,'' he said.}

{\Large{}11.  He didn't have them wad up the tobacco while they were together.}

{\Large{}12. Rather he summoned one man at a time and had each one wad up the tobacco.}

{\Large{}13. Well, then, after the tobacco had been wadded up and placed [before
him],      }

{\Large{}he summoned the smoker.}

{\Large{}14. ``Come here, you!'' he said to the owner of the pipe. He came.}

{\Large{}15. Then he also summoned the one who had stolen the pipe.}

{\Large{}16. ``Come here!'' he said.}

{\Large{}17. ``You, if the pipe is really yours, try putting the tobacco you wadded
into it,'' he said.}

{\Large{}18. When he said ``Try putting it in,'' they went at it with a will [3],
and the one the      }

{\Large{}smoker had made fitted the bowl of the pipe perfectly.}

{\Large{}19. The non-smoker's one was way too big, since he didn't know what he
was doing.}

{\Large{}20. He was jealous of someone else's pipe, and stole it, and even made
a court case out       }

{\Large{}of it and went before the king, but he couldn't win against the pipe-smoker!}

{\Large{}21. That fellow went and robbed someone else's property, went and stole
someone       }

{\Large{}else's possession.}

{\Large{}22. Then, after he had coveted it and stolen it, when he was finally forced
to wad it up,        }

{\Large{}he had no idea of how to do it.}

{\Large{}23. When he was forced to make a wad for it, he crumpled up enough tobacco
for       }

{\Large{}putting into }{\Large{}\textit{two }}{\Large{}pipes --- he didn't know
any better.}

{\Large{}24. He wanted to get ahold of his pipe so he brought the owner to court,
thinking all the       }

{\Large{}time [4] that if a serious issue were made of it he would win.}

{\Large{}25. But it was no use.}

{\Large{}26. He went and stole another's property, and behaved like a miserable
wretch. Paštog̈ [5]}

{\Large{}27. But the real pipe-smoker, in joy and gladness, got back his prized
possession.}

{\Large{}28. And the king threw the wretch into jail for a long time, since he
had stolen       }

{\Large{}what belonged to another.}

{\Large{}29. Pastor Cà-bo: That's right, my boys! ``Don't go sitting on someone
else's stool,'' as       }

{\Large{}the saying goes.  If it's not your own stool.}

{\Large{}30. Thu-yi: (Teasing) Did you say ``don't go shitting'' or ``don't go
sitting''? [6]}

{\Large{}31. Pastor Cà-bo: Don't }{\Large{}\textit{sit}}{\Large{}, I said! That
man who stole the pipe couldn't best the       }

{\Large{}other when it came right down to it in the end.}

{\Large{}32. H: Mm-hm.}
