<told by Headman Ca-bi>

1. Well, once upon a time there were two men.

2. One of them was a tobacco-smoker, he used to smoke all the time. He was a


great smoker.

3. The other one didn't smoke.

4. His pipe --- the smoker's pipe was a very fine one.

5. The inside\footnote{\textbf{ɔ̀-kɛ} `the innermost, hardest part of something, e.g. the pith of a tree'. Here used to mean the inside of the pipe.} of it was red and smooth, and it was streamlined and shiny, so
that

the non- smoker wanted to have it, and stole it away from him.

6. When he had gone and stolen it, the two of them then made a big court case out
of it.

7. They made a big case of it, they were fighting with each other before major
and

minor officials, and finally they reached the king --- and this king was a very
shrewd man.

8. He ordered the non-smoker to make a wad of tobacco to put in the pipe.

9. And he had the real smoker crumple\footnote{\textbf{šú} \textbf{chɨ̂ʔ} \textbf{ve} `to crumple tobacco', i.e. to tear off a chunk of tobacco from a large lump and squeeze it into a ball suitable for insertion into a pipe. Only the owner of the pipe knew the proper sized wad that would fit into it exactly.} some tobacco too.

10. ``Both of you crumple it and put it down here,'' he said.

11. He didn't have them wad up the tobacco while they were together.

12. Rather he summoned one man at a time and had each one wad up the tobacco.

13. Well, then, after the tobacco had been wadded up and placed [before him],


he summoned the smoker.

14. ``Come here, you!'' he said to the owner of the pipe. He came.

15. Then he also summoned the one who had stolen the pipe.

16. ``Come here!'' he said.

17. ``You, if the pipe is really yours, try putting the tobacco you wadded into
it,'' he said.

18. When he said ``Try putting it in,'' they went at it with a will\footnote{\textbf{g̈ɔ̀} \textbf{kə} a \textbf{lɛ}: \textbf{g̈ɔ̀} is a lively pre-head versatile verb.}, and the
one the

smoker had made fitted the bowl of the pipe perfectly.

19. The non-smoker's one was way too big, since he didn't know what he was doing.

20. He was jealous of someone else's pipe, and stole it, and even made a court
case out

of it and went before the king, but he couldn't win against the pipe-smoker!

21. That fellow went and robbed someone else's property, went and stole someone


else's possession.

22. Then, after he had coveted it and stolen it, when he was finally forced to
wad it up,

he had no idea of how to do it.

23. When he was forced to make a wad for it, he crumpled up enough tobacco for


putting into \textit{two }pipes --- he didn't know any better.

24. He wanted to get ahold of his pipe so he brought the owner to court, thinking
all the

time\footnote{``All the time'' translates the reduplicated \textbf{yɔ̂} \textbf{g̈â} \textbf{yɔ̂} \textbf{g̈â} `he'd win, he'd win [he thought].'} that if a serious issue were made of it he would win.

25. But it was no use.

26. He went and stole another's property, and behaved like a miserable wretch.
Paštog̈\footnote{\textbf{chɔ-lù-pā} `a ruined person, a person who has gone bad'.}

27. But the real pipe-smoker, in joy and gladness, got back his prized possession.

28. And the king threw the wretch into jail for a long time, since he had stolen


what belonged to another.

29. Pastor T: That's right, my boys! ``Don't go sitting on someone else's
stool,'' as

the saying goes. If it's not your own stool.

30. Thu-yi: (Teasing) Did you say ``don't go shitting'' or ``don't go sitting''?
\footnote{The original says ``did you say \textbf{tâ} \textbf{mi} (don't catch) or \textbf{tâ} \textbf{mɨ} (don't sit)?'' The humorous impertinence is, if anything, enhanced by this free translation.}

31. Pastor T: Don't \textit{sit}, I said! That man who stole the pipe couldn't
best the

other when it came right down to it in the end.

32. H: Mm-hm.
