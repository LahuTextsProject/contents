1. Once upon a time there was a guy called ɛ̀-qhɛ̀ the Trickster,\footnote{See DL:129.}

O Lahu!

2. This ɛ̀-qhɛ̀ first fashioned legs and stuck them onto an ashy pumpkin


\footnote{\textbf{a-thɛ-phɨ} \textasciitilde{} \textbf{ha-thɛ-phɨ} \textasciitilde{} \textbf{a-thɛ́-phɨ} [\textit{Benincasa hispida}].}, then he sat down by the side of a road, and stayed sitting there.

3. Soon a large group of traders arrived there to do some trading, driving

a hundred mules [loaded with goods].

4. So then the Trickster said, ``O traders, let's trade your mules for

mine!\footnote{I.e., for the ashy pumpkin made to look like a donkey.}

5. ``This one of mine brings forth many babies, and it's also very fast!''

he said.

6. So then that group of traders thought ``It's probably true,'' and they

made the trade.

7. Then, after the Trickster had gotten away with that big herd of

mules, the traders mounted his ashy pumpkin one after the other,

and whipped it with all their might.

8. But since they couldn't get it to move, they lifted it up and flung it into


a má-kwī bush\footnote{A kind of bushy gray creeper with sour shoots and edible black fruits that grow in bunches like grapes.}, whereupon two rabbits that had been in there

jumped out fast, and when the rabbits jumped out and ran away,

they thought ``It's true! By the Buddha, it's true, it's true!''

9. ``Catch `em, catch `em, catch `em, catch `em, go get `em," they said.\footnote{\textbf{ú-chò}: an interjection is used when chasing animals. It was inadvertently omitted from DL.}

10. So after chasing for three days without catching them, they wept

and went back home.
