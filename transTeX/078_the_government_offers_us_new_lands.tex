{\textbf{78 Government Offers Us New Lands}}

{1 H: Well, a message from the government has come to us,[1] to all of us
Lahu. We're going to discuss it. Let everybody come here for a while, please.}

{The matter which we're all going to be discussing this evening is this.
There's talk that they're planning to give us all--all of us [Lahu] who are living
in Thailand--lands, fields, places where we can cultivate the soil, beginning right
now and forever after.[2] But how is this going to come about?}

{2 Cà-bo: I'm tired of hearing this all the time. It's always the same
old story. }

{3 H: Well that's where you're wrong! I tell you they're saying that they're
going to give us land that we can live off forever in the future, for our own adult
generation as well as our children's generation! They say they'll give each person
about twenty rai.[3] What shall we do [about it]? Shall we go take a look at the
places? }

{4 Cà-bo: Where the hell are these places anyway?}

{5 H: Well, }

{5-A T: It's not just in one place.}

{5-B H: I've heard that it's someplace over at Pha-pu-jawn,[4] near where
the Hmong are. Go over there and have a look, they said to me!}

{6 Cà-bo: Didn't somebody say that they've parceled that out to the Hmong
already?}

{7 H: The Hmong won't get all of it. They say they'll give us Lahu our share,
too! }

{8 Cà-bo: With the business of giving some to the Hmong and some to the
Lahu there's only going to be quarreling back and forth.}

{9 H: Oh, they're going to separate off each person's land for him, they
say. They'll measure it off for us. So who all is going to go, to have a look at
it?}

{10 Cà-bo: Well, I for one am not going. From as far back as I can remember
until today I have never lived off a wet-rice field.[5] I've grown up working in
dry mountain-fields, and that's all. There's malaria [down there in the plains]!
I'm afraid of it.[6]}

{11 H: Well, since they're giving out the land, let's go take a look at
it. That's the least we can do.[7] Even if we don't cultivate it right away, we
still have no way of knowing whether we might not gradually have to use it in the
future. They won't be making this offer forever.[8] If there comes a time when
they're not giving it out anymore, even if we want it we won't get it. We really
ought to go out and have a look at it, brothers!}

{12 Cà-bo: You lead them there then. Take Ja-keh and his group and Ja-pho
and his group.}

{13 H: Oh, they'll go, they'll go. One or two of them will go. You should
go early tomorrow morning, after you have something to eat.[9] The official[10]
said that he'd go with us too tomorrow morning, after we eat. He's going to wait
for us. So after we eat--all of you who want to go, everybody who's going, have
something to eat and go up[11] and fetch the leader, then go off together and have
a look. Personally I don't think I'll go along yet. Because I don't have time to
go. Right now I'm just swamped with work,[12] you see.}

{14 Thû-yì: For crying out loud, you're the headman. You have to go! Otherwise
how can you look after the villagers' interests?}

{15 H: Well, I'm not one who's getting any [of that land] yet. It's not
there that I'm getting any [land], so I won't go yet. I'm not going there to look.
But all of you who do want to get some, you go and look it over! }

{16 Cà-bo: Well, when the headman informs the villagers about it this way
but doesn't go himself, I daresay nobody's going to pay any attention to him, in
the future. }

{17 H: For my part, I don't want to get[13] any [land] over there because
it's too far away. I'm going to try to get some that's near here. But all of you
who want to get some, go. If you don't want any ---}

{18 Cà-bo: What you're saying is really very selfish. If it's a place nearby
you'd like to get it for yourself. But other people you'd like to send off to places
far away. If you act like that how can this village prosper?[14]}

{19 H: No, whether it's far or near, if it suits you they'll give it to
you--no matter where it is and no matter how much you want. I'm not saying I'll
take it all for myself! Whether it's good land or bad land they'll share it out
equally, the same to everybody. That's how it's done, when the authorities give
things out. }

{20 Thû-yì: Well, in that case you certainly ought to go look at it--tomorrow,
after you have something to eat.}

{21 H: But I don't want any of it ever at Pha-pu-jaw--really I don't!}

{22 Cà-bo: Just look at him, just look at him! With his own mouth he says
he doesn't want any.}

{23 H: Well then, where would }{\textit{you}}{ like to get
land, eh? Someplace nice and close, right on the }{\textit{nikhom}}{'s
land, not more than a furlong away from Huey Tat, I suppose, right? Well, I [also]
would like to get [some land] right around here. If it's too far away I just can't
afford to go and work there. There's nobody [to help me].[15] I don't have any
children, you know.}

{24 Thû-yì: You won't find any place to make a paddy-field around these
parts! Except for Metalai;[16] that's the only place.}

{25 H: No, if you go over around Mì-g̈â-tù, on the way to the cattle
and elephant grazing place,[17] there's a great big plain! If we can only get water
it'll be a perfect place. Go look around there. }

{26 Cà-bo: Cultivating paddy fields in a desert where there's no water
and earning a living! Maybe your father could, I suppose![18]}

{27 H: Come now! Up above the valley there's a stream called Stony Brook[19]}{\textsuperscript{
-- now if you could just go and dig a channel [from it to the fields] there'd be
all [the water] that you need for cultivation! I guess you haven't been over there
to take a proper look yet. }}

{\textsuperscript{28 Cà-bo: Without spending about ten thousand baht[20]
you wouldn't be able to dig the channel. }}

{\textsuperscript{29 H: No, as long as we've found[21] a place that we want
to have, whatever has to be spent or whatever has to be done the government will
help us. It's a trifling matter for them.[22]}}

{\textsuperscript{30 Cà-bo: Yes, a long time ago, the government was already
telling us \texttt{"}We'll help you, we'll help you!'', but up to today I don't
even see a mouthful of tea [that we've gotten out of them].}}

{\textsuperscript{31 H: The government says that they can do whatever they
set their minds to do. }}

{\textsuperscript{32 Cà-bo: Two or three pigs, fifty or sixty big coffee-plants--how
can anybody earn a living from that sort of thing![23]}}

{\textsuperscript{33 H: Anyhow, whether we do it or not is up to us ---
since they're offering it. We are backwoods people.[24] We're a tiny[25] race of
people. We ought to listen carefully to what the government says. Whatever they
tell us we should do. As we go forward in the future, if each of us doesn't have
his own piece of land here in Thailand, our children and our posterity will suffer
for it.[26] Those of us who are grown-ups really ought to ponder this very carefully
now. In the past too, in this Lahu nation of ours, for generation after generation
people have been thoughtless,[27] so that today whatever we do we are beset with
troubles and difficulties.[28] We have no education, none of the various skills
that other people have. It is because we don't listen to the advice of others that
we have come to this pass. So at this point we should all think things over very
carefully, my brothers!Liši, where would you like to get land, if they offer you
some?}}

{\textsuperscript{33a Liši: Wherever they give it to me, I will accept
it.}}

{\textsuperscript{33b H: Well, that's it, I feel the same as you do. [But]
there isn't anybody who wants to go to Pha-pu-jaw that we were talking about just
now! And you're telling me, \texttt{"}Go! Since you're the headman!\texttt{"} So
what shall I do? }}

{\textsuperscript{34 Cà-bo: Since you're the headman, you really must go.}}

{\textsuperscript{35 H: I don't want to get any [land there], I tell you!
Even if I go there I'm not taking any.}}

{\textsuperscript{36 Cà-bo: But you must go and look for [land] on the
villagers' behalf even though you don't want any for yourself. }}

{\textsuperscript{37 H: If the villagers want it, they'll get it. }}

{\textsuperscript{38 Cà-bo: You've got to go look after things yourself.
If you don't go and watch how they're measuring it off, how will the villagers
know whether it's being done fairly or not? }}

{\textsuperscript{39 H: Well, once they're all through measuring it properly,
I do plan to go, you know.}}

{\textsuperscript{40 Cà-bo: When it comes to doing a job, this kind of
piecemeal, half-hearted[29] way of doing it is really annoying! Year after year
[this trait of yours] hasn't changed,[30] right up to today. It's time for you
to realize this. }}

{\textsuperscript{41 H: Even if you say you want [a certain piece of land]
it doesn't mean that you have to cultivate it right away. If there isn't anybody
to work it at the moment,[31] you can just keep it in reserve[32] for the future!
We'd better take advantage of their offer while it still holds.[33] So all of you
who have the time ought to go tomorrow! Otherwise you might say someday,}}

{\textsuperscript{``You didn't tell me about this.'' ``Even though the government
said they'd give us land, you didn't tell me.'' ``If you had only told me when
they said they'd give it to us!'' ``If we had only known about it, we would have
gone!'', you might say, so now I'm telling you about it while there's still time,
[I'm telling] you all.[34]}}

{\textsuperscript{42 Cà-bo: Yes, well, we've known about this for a long
time, this whole business. However, I don't see any advantage or benefit[35] for
us if we do work [these new fields]. I can only see difficulties. Rather than listening
to that kind of advice, it wouldn't hurt[36] if we paid attention to what the Boss[37]
says. }}

{\textsuperscript{43 H: In the future, when Thailand, this Thailand of ours
gets to be packed chock-full of people, whoever doesn't have his own land is going
to be in trouble, I bet. Now, while they're telling us this in good time, we all
ought to think it over carefully. They're only going to be offering it to us for
a while. If we don't watch out ``By the time our thoughts catch up, the prey can't
be caught!''[38]}}

{\textsuperscript{44 Cà-bo: Well, as far as I'm concerned, I'm still not
going.[39] You all can discuss it and go if you want to. }}

{\textsuperscript{45 H: Well, then, this is where the matter stands. If
there's anybody who wants to go, let him go tomorrow. That's all there is to it.
As for me, I won't be going yet. I don't have the time yet. Because I'm very busy
working, seeing that I don't have anybody [to help me]. Among all of you who want
to go, [why don't] some of you get together and go off hunting or something[40]
from the cattle-tending huts to Porcupine[41] Mountain, and cook yourselves a good
roast and continue on from there![42]}}

{\textsuperscript{46 Thû-yì: Well, but did they say they'd dig out the
paddy-fields for us? What did they say they'd do? }}

{\textsuperscript{47 H: No, they're not going to dig out the field for us.
We've got to dig ours out all by ourselves. We'll have a go at it, then if it turns
out that we can't, in case we're not able to do it,[43] we'll just tell the government
officials. The government will take care of us and help us, they said. Also, in
the matter of bringing water [to the fields], even if it's a long way, if the regime--er,
if the government[44] helps us, we'll make it all right. Little people that we[45]
all are, we've been thinking \texttt{"}This is impossible and that is impossible\texttt{"}
-- that's how we think. But, look, if we don't have fields, land to till, whatever
we might try to do in the future, it will really be impossible [for us to get anywhere].
Everybody had better think this over mighty fast. Elephant and cattle stamping
ground, now, [that's a place] I'd like to get, too.[46] They say the tree-stumps
there are big, but we could chop them out, [to till our] fields. In a year or two
we could have them burned out and be earning a living from our paddy-fields. Oh,
I'm sure we could! So, as far as I'm concerned, I want the big stretch of flat
land above the cattle-tending hut -- the whole plain, above everybody else's [fields].}}

{\textsuperscript{48 Cà-bo: You're so greedy! That's just it.[47] That's
why nobody wants to go [with you], why nobody wants to follow your lead! }}

{\textsuperscript{49 H: Ha, ha! That's nonsense, that is!}}

{\textsuperscript{50      : He's right, he's right!}}

{\textsuperscript{51 H: Okay, okay, I'll take [land] at the tail-end of
everybody instead,[48] if that's the way you feel. Way below everybody else, down
at the rocky ridge --- }}

{\textsuperscript{\texttt{<}everybody talks at once\texttt{>}}}

{\textsuperscript{52 Thû-yì: Hold on! The land down there is mine!}}

{\textsuperscript{53 H: Down there at HÁ-tó-cē in the plains near Kɛ̀-ma-lón.}}

{\textsuperscript{54 Cà-bo: Just look at him, just look at him. Now even
though they aren't going they've already been fighting over it --- acting like
this, there's no way we can earn a living.}}

{\textsuperscript{55 Pà-ɛ́: It's mine, it's mine! The land down there
is mine! }}

{\textsuperscript{56 H: Look, when the authorities give it to us, we'll
carefully measure it off, the good places as well as the bad, and divide it up.
Everybody will get an equal share.[49]}}

{\textsuperscript{57 Thû-yì: Me, if it's bad land I'm not taking it!}}

{\textsuperscript{58 Pà-ɛ́: I won't take it either -- I won't!}}

{\textsuperscript{59 H: What our forefathers said ... what you've been saying
is, ``When I said I wanted to take the upper part, you said you wouldn't give it
to me.'' But according to what our forefathers said long ago, it's the lower part
which is to be taken. Because when you get land below other people's, you can[51]
gradually move a little bit upwards one year, and a little bit further upwards
the second year, until someday the one who got the lower part will get all the
upper fields as well! There's an old saying to that effect --- it's a good one.
So if I say I want the upper part, why don't you give it to me!}}

{\textsuperscript{60 Cà-bo: Just look at him, just look at him! Now he's
even teaching you the way to rob other people of their possessions!}}

{\textsuperscript{61 H: I'm not robbing anybody, I'm not robbing anybody!
I [told] you I'd take the upper part even if there wasn't enough water. [But when
I said] I'd take the upper part, what you said was \texttt{"}If it's a good place
you take it for yourself!\texttt{"} So now I'm saying I'll take [land] down there,
way downhill from everybody else in the rocky plains down there! }}

{\textsuperscript{62 Cà-bo: Well, then, what about what you were saying
there about digging your way upwards little by little into other peoples' [land]?}}

{\textsuperscript{63 H: \texttt{<}Laughs\texttt{>} Oh, that! You know there's
an old saying like that, don't you? \texttt{"}When you stake out a paddy-field,
stake it out low! If you get a high field, you may get water, but cold water makes
for bad paddy. If you get land below the others, one day you will get to be greater
than they\texttt{"} -- isn't that what they say? As our ancestors have said, \texttt{"}The
first year while you hoe your weeds, undermine the paddy-field boundaries[56] a
little and push up a ways. The next year dig under again and advance upwards another
length. [That is how you become] great.\texttt{"} So I'm just trying to get other
people's [property] for myself! }}

{\textsuperscript{64 Cà-bo: And here's where your great greed comes in!}}

{\textsuperscript{65 H: It's not greed at all! You guys don't want it. It
should be given to me!}}

{\textsuperscript{66 Cà-bo: Then let each one of us go down and work only
in his own place!}}

{\textsuperscript{67 H: Well--}}

{\textsuperscript{68 Cà-bo: This business of knocking over and breaking
up other people's boundaries, you would always have to make new ones and there'd
be no end to it.}}

{\textsuperscript{69 H: [I'm not saying] ``Knock them over and break them
up\texttt{"}--when the water weeds are thick around there, if you just dig at them
a teeny-weeny bit, the earth comes tumbling down [into your field]--if it's soaked
with water. }}

{\textsuperscript{70 Cà-bo: Terrific, I'll keep scraping yours away too,
then!}}

{\textsuperscript{71 H: \texttt{<}Laughing\texttt{>} I'm only kidding![58]
You're talking nonsense![59]}}

{\textsuperscript{72 Pà-ɛ́: Don't cultivate the upper part. Don't cultivate
the [whole] middle part. Dividing up the middle part, each person will get half.
I'll tear them [the boundary markers] down.}}

{\textsuperscript{73 H: Will you do it honestly?---Well, you know what people
say, if they're narrow ones--if all the strips [of land] are narrow, they'll say,
\texttt{"}It's too long! I don't want it!\texttt{"}[61] So let everybody measure
off his own section squarely. }}

{\textsuperscript{74 Thû-yì: Well, if you keep doing it that way...}}

{\textsuperscript{75 Cà-bo: Don't give any to people who don't want to
accept it.}}

{\textsuperscript{76 Thû-yì: It doesn't look nice, it doesn't look nice.}}

{\textsuperscript{77 H: When I'm making the boundaries between the sections,
I'll certainly try to do it in such a way that each and every person gets enough.}}

{\textsuperscript{78 Thû-yì: Well--}}

{\textsuperscript{79 Pà-ɛ́: I'll bet they'll tear them down.}}

{\textsuperscript{80 H: Oh, you people are talking at cross-purposes here[63]!
Just talking at cross-purposes. When the government is good enough to give us something,
let everybody at least go and have a proper look at it! No matter what land falls
to any individual's lot.}}

{\textsuperscript{81 Thû-yì: It depends entirely on the government.}}

{\textsuperscript{82 H: Look, when the government gives us something there's
nothing for us to go complain about, is there? Shaw-hpa has suggested that we draw
lots! You'd write down the paddy-field [locations] and put them in [the pool],
then you'd draw the lots, and whichever piece you happen to get, it would be that
land which you'd--that area there that you would get. }}

{\textsuperscript{83 Cà-bo: would never work. When you draw lots [and you
lose] it's not a happy business. }}

{\textsuperscript{84 H: It's because nobody agrees on how to divide it up!
So what can we do about it? }}

{\textsuperscript{85 Cà-bo: What'll happen is, when the lots are drawn
a loser[71] will--}}

{\textsuperscript{86 H: The hell with losers! they just won't get it, that's
all. }}

{\textsuperscript{87 Thû-yì: Well, if we draw lots and I don't get a good
place, I simply won't take it! Even if it falls to my lot. }}

{\textsuperscript{88 Pà-ɛ́: I'd take it, I'd take it! }}

{\textsuperscript{89 H: Well, if that's the way it is, there's nothing to
be done with you people. Well, if you won't even do what they advise you to do,
let somebody else tell you what to do, let somebody else tell you. We're all just
quarreling with each other and not getting anyplace. }}

{\textsuperscript{90 Cà-bo: Let me decide, let me decide! I'll solve them
for you, all these problems of yours. If there is anybody now who doesn't want
to get any [land] as the headman said to, let him just give his share to the Lisu,[72]
all of it. }}

{\textsuperscript{91 H: Which place do you mean? }}

{\textsuperscript{92 Cà-bo: Even the [lands] at Pha-pu-jawn.}}

{\textsuperscript{93 H: The ones at Pha-pu-jawn, now--}}

{\textsuperscript{94 Cà-bo: And let [the lands] at the ``cattle and elephant
stamping grounds'' be given away, too! You people are so stubborn[74] right now!
}}

{\textsuperscript{95 Lisu: I for one will take them!}}

{\textsuperscript{96 H: So how are you guys going to go and earn a living
in the future?}}

{\textsuperscript{97 Lisu: No matter where we work for our living[75] we'll
just be scratching out a bare existence anyway.}}

{\textsuperscript{98 Thû-yì: Well, if we haven't got places to live off,
someday we'll be in trouble.}}

{\textsuperscript{99 H: As for me, I don't care whether I get any [new land]
or not.}}

{\textsuperscript{100 Cà-bo: That's why you're not going, eh?}}

{\textsuperscript{101 H: If I don't get any I won't be angry. If I do get
some, I won't be happy.}}

{\textsuperscript{102 Cà-bo: You're just saying that with your mouth![76]
You do that with everything.}}

{\textsuperscript{103 H: See here, now, I've grown old working old fields[77]
these many years! Among you there's nobody who earns his living [that way]. Me,
each year I work somebody else's old field, a different one each time. I go roaming
around and earn my living.[79]}}

{\textsuperscript{104 Lisu: Okay, keep scrabbling for a living then! All
by yourself.}}

{\textsuperscript{105 H: Scrabble I will. I'm not going.}}

{\textsuperscript{106 Lisu: Stay sitting all forlorn[80] and keep scratching
for a living!}}

{\textsuperscript{107 H: When people give you fellows advice, you don't
pay any attention. Even when those important people advise you and tell you what
to do, you still don't want to listen.}}

{\textsuperscript{108 Lisu: The one who doesn't want to listen is you!}}

{\textsuperscript{109 Cà-bo: You just sit under an eggplant-berry bush[82]
and scratch for a living!}}

{\textsuperscript{110 H: There's a saying about the Lahu people,[83] that
\texttt{"}when one of us is working, the other turns away.'' He is obstructed.
``When one of us is carrying on his work, the other pulls him back.'' We can't
go on like this. We Lahu, no matter what we do--}}

{\textsuperscript{111 Cà-bo: ``While one man is climbing a tree, the other
is pulling at his legs'' --- that saying is to the point here.}}

{\textsuperscript{112 H: Because we don't want to obey the laws and customs
of our superiors or even listen to what they're saying.}}

{\textsuperscript{113 Cà-bo: It's all because you didn't listen from the
very beginning when people were telling you \texttt{"}Don't do this, don't do that,
it's impossible!\texttt{"} So today, you see, it's nothing but troubles, whatever
we do. No matter who teaches you, you won't listen!}}

{\textsuperscript{114 H: Well, unless we let those government officials
handle it for us I don't see what we can do. }}

{\textsuperscript{115 Cà-bo: Then let's leave it to the government. You
people don't quarrel about it anymore!}}
