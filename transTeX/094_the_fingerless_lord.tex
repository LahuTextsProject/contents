{\LARGE{}1. Once there was a certain lord.}

{\LARGE{}2. Under this lord there was a high minister. [1]}

{\LARGE{}3. One day during the time this minister was in the lord's service,  while
he was staying close [2] by him, one of     }

{\LARGE{}his [the lord's] middle fingers rotted and broke off. [3]}

{\LARGE{}4. When this middle finger rotted off he showed it [his hand] to the minister.}

{\LARGE{}5. ``Minister, one of my fingers, one of my middle fingers has rotted
off.}

{\LARGE{}6. ``What shall I do? Come here, and look!''}

{\LARGE{}7. When he said this, and when the minister came and was shown it, [he]
said, ``My lord, everything that happens     }

{\LARGE{}is for the best.'' [4]}

{\LARGE{}5. So the lord immediately became angry, and since he was so furious,
while he was thinking [about what to do],     }

{\LARGE{}he took [the Minister] along far into a forest, where he [the lord] saw
a place where there was a deep pit in    }

{\LARGE{}the ground.}

{\LARGE{}6. When he saw this place, he said to the minister, ``Come here quickly,
come here quickly! I wonder what that is over there!''}

{\LARGE{}7. And the minister rushed to come, and while he was straining to see,
[the lord] slowly pushed him so that he fell   }

{\LARGE{}into [the pit].}

{\LARGE{}8. After the minister had entered the pit, the lord continued on to another
place, where he found himself face to     }

{\LARGE{}face with a large band of naked savages who ate human flesh.}

{\LARGE{}8. When they saw him they wanted to eat his flesh, but as they were about
to kill him, they said ``Take a good     }

{\LARGE{}look at everything about this person that is different from other people
