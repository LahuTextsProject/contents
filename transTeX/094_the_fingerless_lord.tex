94 The Fingerless Lord

\. Once there was a certain lord.

\. Under this lord there was a high minister. \footnote{\textbf{a-màʔ-ló}: \texttt{<} [WB \textbf{ʔamat}] `minister; vizier; high}

\. One day during the time this minister was in the lord's service, while he was
staying close \footnote{The Lahu verb-particle/ Pv \textbf{šē} (called \textbf{šē}R or the ``\textbf{šē}} by him, one of his [the lord's] middle fingers rotted and broke
off.\footnote{`while staying close' translates the reduplication of \textbf{chɛ̂} (V) `be}

4a. When this middle finger rotted off he showed it [his hand] to the minister.

4b. ``Minister, one of my fingers---one of my middle fingers has rotted off.

4c. ``What shall I do? Come here, and look!''

4d. When [he] said this, and when the minister came and [he] showed it [to him],
[he] said, ``My lord, everything that happens is for the best.'' \footnote{\textbf{ɔ̀-bo ɨ̄ ve}: lit. ``the advantage/ grace'' is great. For a discussion}

\. So the lord immediately became angry, and since he was so furious, while he
was thinking [about what to do], he took [the Minister] along far into a forest,
where he [the lord] saw a place where there was a \{deep hole/ pit\} in the ground.

6a. When he saw this place, he said to the minister, ``Come here quickly, come
here quickly!  I wonder what that is over there!''

6b. And the minister came and while he was straining to see, [the lord] \{gently/
slowly\} pushed him so he fell in[to the pit].

\. After the minister had entered the pit \footnote{Presumably he had to stay there for some time, with food periodically thrown}, when the lord \{one day/ once\}
was going \{to a certain place/ someplace\}, he found himself face to face with
a large band of savages who ate human flesh.

\. When [they/ the cannibals] saw him they wanted to eat his flesh, but when they
were about to kill him, they said ``Take a good look at everything about this person
that is different from other people \footnote{\textbf{šu lɔ  mâ  šū}.}---one of his middle fingers is \{not there/
missing\}!''

\. For this reason they couldn't eat him, and when this happened, all of a sudden
he realized something ---he recognized his good fortune.

1\. So since he came to realize [the truth of] the minister's [words] ``Everything
that happens is for the best,'' he straightaway turned back and had the minister
pulled out [of the pit].

1\. If we say ``What \{meaning/ moral\} can we extract from this?'' everything
that happened previously, all the things we complained and bickered about, are
all for the best!

1\. Somebody corrects him: I suppose so. \footnote{The narrator ends with the emphatic Pnf \textbf{mɛ̄} after the declarative}
