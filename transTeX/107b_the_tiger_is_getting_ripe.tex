107b The Tiger is Getting Ripe

1 Then there's the one about\footnote{Literally, `after this has been done, once upon a time...'.} how once upon a time there were two men, a Yellow
Lahu and a Black Lahu.

2 They went along a road and reached the place where the Lahu fields were.

3 When they got there, the Black Lahu climbed up on top of a log [overlooking the
fields], to see how the Lahu paddy was ripening.

4 Then the Black Lahu went over and said, ``Friend, down there our Lahu paddy is
getting ripe!

5 And there's paddy getting ripe up there too!'' he said --- to the Yellow Lahu.

6 Now when the Yellow Lahu say ``câ-mɛ'', they mean ``tiger''.\footnote{The misunderstanding involves a three-syllable pun. In YL, câ-mɛ means `tiger'}

7 Thinking that['s what was meant], the Yellow Lahu took to his heels.

8 So then this Black Lahu chased after him, and they got up onto the mountaintop,
and finally came to a halt on the other side of the mountain.

9 When they got there he asked, ``What did we see that made you go running away
like this?''\footnote{Literally, `our having seen what, are you going fleeing?'}

10 Then the Yellow Lahu answered, ``As we were talking --- didn't you just say
`A tiger's coming!'?''

11 Afterwards the two of them had a good laugh over it.
