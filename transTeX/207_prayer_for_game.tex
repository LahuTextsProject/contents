207 Prayer for Game

1 Oh today, at this place, I offer you this silver altar, this golden altar; you
who watch over the seven thousand male pigs and female pigs on the right-hand side,
you who watch over the seven million male pigs and female pigs on the left-hand
side, you ruler, you great ruler of this place.

2 Oh I ask for male pigs and female pigs, I ask for male barking deer and female
barking deer.

3 Today I bring for you these offerings, I place them under your feet and under
your hands.

4 Oh do not make it difficult for me [to shoot these animals]; make it easy for
me [to shoot them]; catch them in your iron chain, your copper chain, and when
I am walking around the summit of the hill, take and put [these animals] at the
summit of the hill; when I am walking around the foot of the hill take and put
[these animals] at the foot of the hill; cover [their eyes] with leaves.

5 Oh, with one half [of the flesh I obtain] I wish to follow the custom of the
elders, I wish to follow the custom of the menfolk and the womenfolk;\footnote{This is a poetic reference to the custom of dividing any large game which these} one half
[of the flesh] I desire for my wife and my children, and for my kinsmen.

6 I pray to you that I may have no difficulty [in obtaining game]; please give
me [flesh to eat].

7 Today, before the setting of the sun, give me [success in the hunt]; when I am
walking around the summit of the hill, take and put [the animals] at the summit
of the hill; when I am walking around the foot of the hill, take and put [the animals]
at the foot of the hill.

8 We people have no truth, we have no honesty;\footnote{Exaggerated humility is one of the ploys commonly used to try and win the spirits'} into your feet and into your
hands I place my request that I may have no difficulty [in obtaining game]; today,
before the setting of the sun, please give me [flesh] to eat.

9 Oh put [the animals] over there at the summit of the hill, cover [their eyes]
with leaves, catch them in your iron chain, your copper chain, put them in front
of me and lead them to my iron gun, my copper gun; you who are all-true, all-honest,
I myself have no truth, no honesty, but I put my request under your feet, under
your hands.

10 Oh today, I offer you this silver altar, this golden altar; I offer you this
silver pendant, this golden pendant;\footnote{Reference to the symbolic ``centipede'' and ``earring'' pendants.} I offer you this food and drink, and I
put my request under your feet and under your hands.

11 Please give me [flesh] to eat; one half I desire for my wife and children, with
one half I wish to follow the custom of the elders, I wish to follow the custom
of the menfolk and the womenfolk.

12 I put my request under your feet and under your hands, [let me shoot] male pigs
and female pigs, male barking deer and female barking deer, which I may divide
up;\footnote{That is, ``Let me shoot large animals, not small ones likely squirrels and} give me [flesh] to eat; today, before the setting of the sun, give me [flesh]
to eat, and receive [these offerings].
