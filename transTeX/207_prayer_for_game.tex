\textbf{\#207 Prayer for Game}

1 Oh today, at this place, I offer you this silver altar, this golden altar \footnote{\textbf{ thī-ŋə̂-thī-khâ}: 'silver and gold altar'. A poetic way of referring to the modest construction of bamboo used in this prayer. [See Plate 38 in Matisoff 1988.] The spirits are conceived of as powerful but rather stupid, easily deceived by hyperbolic language.},
you who watch over the seven thousand male and female pigs on the right-hand side,
you who watch over the seven million male and female pigs on the left-hand side,
you rulers, great princes of this place. \footnote{This prayer is directed mainly to the Hill Spirit (\textbf{qhɔ-nê}), the guardian of the game in a certain area, but in order to avoid any problems, it is also addressed to the local Shan legendary princes or deities.}

2 Oh, I beg for male and female pigs, I beseech you for male and female barking
deer.

3 Today I bring for you these offerings, I place them under your feet and under
your hands. \footnote{Lit., ``they have reached your feet and hands``.}

4 Oh, do not block me up with distress! Make them easy for me to shoot! Bind them
with your chains of iron and brass! And when I am stalking around the summit of
a hill, take and put them at the summit of the hill; when I am following a trail
around the foot of a hill, take and put them at the foot of the hill!  Cover [their
eyes] with leaves!

5 Oh, one half [of the meat I obtain] I wish to contribute according to the sharing
customs of the elders, I wish to follow the customs of the menfolk and the womenfolk
