{\LARGE{}137 Man's Primeval Gourd Goes Missing, and God Looks For It}

{\LARGE{}1. Once upon a time, when God created the [first] human being, He created
him to stay inside a gourd [1], it is said.}

{\LARGE{}2. One day a bat lit off a }{\LARGE{}\textit{tawkaw}}{\LARGE{}-fruit[2]
so that it fell right down, and since there was a barking-deer dozing under the
}{\LARGE{}\textit{tawkaw}}{\LARGE{}-tree, it fell crashing down on him, and because
he was startled he suddenly jumped up and ran away into an old field. [3]}

{\LARGE{}3. A jungle-chicken also flew over, and alighted\} on a cassia shrub [4]}

{\LARGE{}4. At that time a horse was also grazing under the cassia.}

{\LARGE{}5. That horse got very scared, so he ran away, and this reached the ears
of an elephant.}

{\LARGE{}6. Since the elephant was also very frightened, when he was running away
full tilt he happened to step on the gourd and made it roll [5] [away down a slope].}

{\LARGE{}7. One day when God came to visit the human, he couldn't find him, so
he summoned all the animals and all the trees, and asked them [where the human
was].}

{\LARGE{}8. Then when God asked the pine tree, the pine tree said ``I didn't see
anything.''}

{\LARGE{}9. So God said, ``When the human gets out [of the gourd], may he chop
you down!}

{\LARGE{}10. And do not ever again put out sprouts [6]!'' Because God said that,
to this very day the pine tree puts out no sprouts.}

{\LARGE{}11. Then when he went on to question the butterfly, but since the butterfly
also said ``I didn't see anything,'' God said, ``And as for you, every day, rain
or shine, you will have to go look for food.'' And since He said that, every day
they have to look for their food.}

{\LARGE{}12. Then he went on to ask the }{\LARGE{}\textit{peh-meu}}{\LARGE{}[7]
bug, and the }{\LARGE{}\textit{peh-meu}}{\LARGE{} bug said, ``I saw it go down
into the water down there.``  So since he told Him this God said, ``May
your kind always have liquid!''  And because God blessed him thus, to this very
day his species produces a liquid.}

{\LARGE{}13. Then God called all the animals together again, and made them [try
to] take the gourd back out of the water [ÃÅ8].}

{\LARGE{}14. All the animals, all the different kinds of animals then tried to
take it out, but they could not.}

{\LARGE{}15. A kind of crab then grabbed it, and placed it on the bank for Him.[9]}

{\LARGE{}16. Then God went on to say: ``Whoever [10] manages to take this human
out of the gourd will get to eat the first fruits of their successful labor in
the fields!'' When he said this, the starling said, ``I'll get him out, if that's
the way it is.'' And when God said, ``If you can do it, do it!,'' the starling
said, ``My beak is very long!'', and all day and all night he pecked away at it.}

{\LARGE{}17. But even though that beak of his got all worn down, it couldn't pierce
through.}

{\LARGE{}18. Then the rat said in his turn, ``}{\LARGE{}\textit{I'll}}{\LARGE{}
now get him out!'', and he gnawed away and pierced it through.}

{\LARGE{}19. When he pierced through, unfortunately[11] he slightly bit the human's
nose as he gnawed .[12]}

{\LARGE{}20. Thus to this day, we have an indentation [13] between our eyes.[14]}

{\LARGE{}21. And to this very day, rats live secretly with humans, and have permission
to keep sneakily eating people's food and drink, people's rice.}
