137 Man's Primeval Gourd Goes Missing, and God Looks For It

1. Once upon a time, when God created a [the first] human being, He created him
to stay inside a gourd \footnote{The Freudian analysis of this creation myth is obvious: gourd = womb}, it is said.

2. One day a bat lit off a \textit{tawkaw}-fruit\footnote{The \textbf{tɔ́-kɔ} iš a kind of palm with very large leaves, bearing plentiful} so it fell right down, and
since there was a barking-deer dozing under the \textit{tawkaw}-tree, it fell crashing
down on him, and because he was startled he suddenly jumped up and ran away into
an old field. \footnote{\textbf{hɛ-šā}: a swidden allowed to lie fallow and revert to jungle over}

3. A jungle-chicken also flew over, and \{alit/alighted\} on a cassia shrub \footnote{\textbf{mì-cɛ̀}: cassia (a shrub with red flowers)}

4. At that time a horse was also \{eating grass/grazing\} under the cassia.

5. That horse got very scared, so he ran away, and it \{came to/ entered\} the
ears of an elephant.

6. Since the elephant was also very frightened, when he \{was running/ran\} away
full tilt \footnote{\textbf{g̈â-thèʔ}} he happened to step on the gourd and made it roll \footnote{\textbf{g̈a nâʔ-pu}: happen to (g̈a) + step (\textbf{nâʔ}) + roll (\textbf{pu})} [away down
a slope].

7. One day when God came to visit the human, he couldn't find him, so he summoned
all the animals and all the Trees, and asked them [where the human was].

8. Then when God asked the pine tree, the pine tree said ``I didn't see.''

9. God said, ``When the human gets out [of the gourd], may he chop you down!''

10. And do not ever again \{put out/sprout\} sprouts \footnote{\textbf{ɔ̀-cā cā ve}: lit. ``sprout sprouts,'' a cognate object construction}!'' -- because God said
that, to this very day the pine tree puts out no sprouts.

11. Then when he went on to question the butterfly, since the butterfly also said
``I didn't see,'' God said, ``And as for you, every day, rain or shine, you will
have to go look for food'' -- and since He said that, every day [butterflies] have
to look for their food.

12. Then he went on to ask the \textit{peh-men}\footnote{\textbf{pɛ̂-mə̂(n)-cèʔ}: a tiny bee-like insect, the size of a fly, that} bug, and the \textit{peh-men}
bug said, ``I saw it go down into the water down there, so since he told Him this
God said, ``May your kind always have \{juice/liquid\}!'' -- and because God blessed
him thus, to this very day, his species produces a liquid.

13. Then God called all the animals together again, and made them [try to] take
the gourd out from the water.

14. All the animals, all the different kinds of animals then [tried to] take it
out, but they could not.

15. \{A kind of crab/a member of the species called crab\}\footnote{This very sentence, used as an example in DL 854, there receives a different} then \{took/grabbed\}
it, and place it on the bank for Him.\footnote{\textbf{Á-cè-gu tê cə̀}}

16. Then God went on to say: ``Whoever manages to take this human out of the gourd
will get to sit and eat the first fruits of their labor in the fields!'' -- when
he said this, the starling said, ``I'll get him out, if that's the way it is,''
and when God said, ``If you can do it, do it!,'' the starling said, ``My beak is
very long!'' and all day and all night he pecked [at it].

17. But even though that beak of his got all worn down, it couldn't pierce through.

18. Then the rat said in his turn, ``\textit{I'll} now get him out!'' and he then
gnawed away and pierced through.

19. When he pierced through, unfortunately\footnote{\textbf{šē} particle expressing regret} he slightly bit the human's nose
as he gnawed \.\footnote{\textbf{gə̀ʔ-hə̂ʔ}: `hit by gnawing'}

20. Thus to this day, [we] have \{an indentation/ a dent\}\footnote{\textbf{chèʔ-kú-lɛ̀ʔ}} between our eyes.\footnote{This was illustrated for me by a sketch [INSERT]}

21. Thus to this very day, rats live secretly with humans, and have permission
to keep secretly eating people's food and drink, people's rice.
