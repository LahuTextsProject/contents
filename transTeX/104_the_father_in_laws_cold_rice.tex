1. Well, once there was a certain person.

2. He was an expert hunter.

3. All he ever did was hunt animals.

4. He earned his living only by the money he got from hunting.

5. Day after day all he did was hunt.

6. One day he walked and walked and caught a bear in a distant place.

7. Having caught this bear, since he couldn't carry it, he stripped off its skin
and tied it up to dry on the stump of a thornbush.

8. Then he took a crap and went home.

9. After he got home he said to his son-in-law, ``Son-in-law, go and carry
back the bearskin over there!"

10. So the son-in-law went off.

11. But nobody saw him come back.

12. The son-in-law had gone to look, and was struggling to carry the bearskin that
had thorns stuck to it.

13. So when the thorns pricked him he said, ``If you bite me, I'll bite
you too!",

and he kept on biting them back violently.

14. Then when the father-in-law got to the place where he had taken a crap, he saw
his son-in-law eagerly eating it!

15. ``Son-in-law, what are you doing?'' he said, so the son-in-law
said, ``My goodness, father-in-law, if you hadn't left this cold rice for
me I would have died of hunger!"
