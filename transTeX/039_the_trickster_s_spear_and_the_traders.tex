{\LARGE{}\textbf{\#39 The Trickster's Spear and the Traders}}

{\LARGE{}1. Well, then, there was still another Trickster. [1]}

{\LARGE{}2. He put down a packet of rice on the lower part of a road.}

{\LARGE{}3. On the upper part of the road he put a packet of curry. [2]}

{\LARGE{}4. When he was ambling along carrying a spear, a band of traders came
}

{\LARGE{}along, and [he said to them]:}

{\LARGE{}5. ``Hey you guys, don't do any [other] trading now! [3]}

{\LARGE{}6. ``Just trade me your things!}

{\LARGE{}7. ``Let's trade this spear of mine for your belongings. I'll
trade my spear      }

{\LARGE{}with you.}

{\LARGE{}8. ``This spear of mine has magic powers! [4]}

{\LARGE{}9. ``If you stick it down into the lower part of the road, you
get rice to eat.}

{\LARGE{}10. ``If you stick it down into the upper part of the road, you
get meat to eat,''       }

{\LARGE{}he said.}

{\LARGE{}11. So then those traders said ``Let's check it out!'', and when they
did it,      }

{\LARGE{}when they stuck it into [the earth on] the lower part of the road, they
got       }

{\LARGE{}a packet of rice.}

{\LARGE{}12. When they stuck it into the upper part of the road, they got a packet
}

{\LARGE{}of chicken.}

{\LARGE{}13. So then they were ecstatic, and they thought, ``It's true!'', and
after      }

{\LARGE{}the Orphan had obtained their horses and had fled,       }

{\LARGE{}when that band of traders got hungry at noontime, they thrust that
}

{\LARGE{}spear down into the lower part of the road, but they didn't get anything.}

{\LARGE{}14. When they thrust it into the upper part of the road they got nothing
either.}

{\LARGE{}15. So when this happened they wept and went back home.}
