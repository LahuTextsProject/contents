107d A Sticky Problem

1 Then there were two [other] people, once upon a time, named Stickney and Stuckney.

2 One morning they were going along together, when [one of them] said:

3 ``Let's go trap us some parakeets early tomorrow morning, okay?''

4 So the next morning they went off together.

5 When they had finished laying the parakeet-traps, a parakeet came and got stuck\footnote{The traps were some sort of contrivance on which a sticky substance (bird-lime)}
on it --- on [the trap] of Stickney [the BL].

6 Thereupon Stuckney [the YL] said, ``Friend, it's stuck on yours!''

7 Then, another one got stuck over on [the trap] of Stuckney [the YL].

8 At this he [i.e., the BL, Stickney] said, ``Friend, now there's one stuck on
yours too!''

9 Then the two of them got furious at each other and began fighting.\footnote{Actually Stuckney [the YL] must have started the fight, since it was he who}

10 As they fought, they ended up way down in the river --- and [all because] he
[Stickney, the BL] had said, ``The parakeets aren't paying any attention to yours!''
