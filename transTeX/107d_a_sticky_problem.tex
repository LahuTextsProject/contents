{\LARGE{}107d A Sticky Problem--OLD VERSION}

{\LARGE{}1 Then there were two [other] people, once upon a time, named Stickney
and Stuckney.}

{\LARGE{}2 One morning they were going along together, when [one of them] said:}

{\LARGE{}3 ``Let's go trap us some parakeets early tomorrow morning, okay?''}

{\LARGE{}4 So the next morning they went off together.}

{\LARGE{}5 When they had finished laying the parakeet-traps, a parakeet came and
got stuck[1] on it --- on [the trap] of Stickney [the BL].}

{\LARGE{}6 Thereupon Stuckney [the YL] said, ``Friend, it's stuck on yours!''}

{\LARGE{}7 Then, another one got stuck over on [the trap] of Stuckney [the YL].}

{\LARGE{}8 At this he [i.e., the BL, Stickney] said, ``Friend, now there's one
stuck on yours too!''}

{\LARGE{}9 Then the two of them got furious at each other and began fighting.[2]}

{\LARGE{}10 As they fought, they ended up way down in the river --- and [all because]
he [Stickney, the BL] had said, ``The parakeets aren't paying any attention to
yours!''}
