1 Today I took a gun, a crossbow, and a knife and, carrying my shoulder-bag, I
went off hunting and I saw a male wild boar!

2 When I saw the wild boar I took a shot at him and hit him in the armpit.

3 When I hit him in the armpit I caught him.

4 When I caught him I headed for home, and by the roadside I aimed my crossbow
and I shot my gun at some squirrels.

5 I'd happened to arrive at a ``squirrel-path''\footnote{This refers to the paths that squirrels take when traveling from tree to tree, availing themselves of creepers and vines.} and caught two or three squirrels,
which I shared with my relatives.\footnote{After the usual word for ``relatives'' (a-ví-a-ni), the speaker uses the word yàʔ-kà-ma, for which I have yet to find the meaning.}

6 Since I couldn't carry the wild boar meat, I went and left it by the roadside,
and the next morning when the sun came out I took a bunch of young men with me
and we carried it back.
