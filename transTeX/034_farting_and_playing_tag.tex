34 Farting and Playing Tag

1. Now I'd like to tell you (an old/a traditional\} Lahu story.  Listen up now.

2. Once upon a time a father-in-law and a son-in-law were farting and playing tag.
I'll tell you about it now, so listen.

3. The father-in-law said, ``Hey, son-in-law, if you're so smart, try catching
me when I fart.''\footnote{His fart would be the signal to start the game.}

4. ``OK,'' the son-in-law said, ``I'll chase you.  But you be quiet first.''

5. The father-in-law said, ``You're a real son-in-law!\footnote{mÁ tɛ̀ yò lɔ; probably an elliptical way of saying mÁ cà jâ tɛ̀ yò} You've chased me and
caught me.  You're a real son-in-law!''

6. That's pretty funny, isn't it!  Very amusing.

7. That's this Lahu story.  That's the end.
