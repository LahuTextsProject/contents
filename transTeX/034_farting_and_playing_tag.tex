34 Farting and Playing Tag

1. Now I'd like to tell you (an old/a traditional\} Lahu story.  Listen up now.

2. Once upon a time a father-in-law and a son-in-law were farting and playing tag.
I'll tell you about it now, so listen.

3. The father-in-law said, ``Hey, son-in-law, if you're so smart, try catching
me when I fart.''\footnote{His fart would be the signal to start the game.}

4. ``OK,'' the son-in-law said, ``I'll chase you.  But you be quiet first.''

5. The father-in-law said, ``You're a real son-in-law!\footnote{mÁ tɛ̀ yò lɔ; probably an elliptical way of saying mÁ cà jâ tɛ̀ yò lɔ, `Son-in-law is really smart!'  Exegesis:  The point to this story is rather obscure.  Perhaps the s-i-l's telling the f-i-l to be quiet first was a clever way of ensuring that the f-i-l couldn't sneak in a silent fart and get too much of a head start.  But why did the f-i-l say, ``You've chased and caught me?''  In my original notebook I had written:  ``The narrative would be much improved by an interpretation like: qhe te lɛ ɔ̀-pū chi tê pɔ̂ʔ tí qhɛ̂ tê qhɛ̂ tèʔ qha-pî lɛ, ɔ̀-mÁ yɔ̂ thàʔ g̈àʔ-yù veyò. tê khɨ gà lɨ à-pū thàʔ g̈àʔ-mi ve yò.''  But then why did s-i-l tell f-i-l to be quiet before starting?} You've chased me and
caught me.  You're a real son-in-law!''

6. That's pretty funny, isn't it!  Very amusing.

7. That's this Lahu story.  That's the end.
