116 A Liar ``Kills'' a Bear and a Mountain Goat

\. Once upon a time there was a \{married couple/husband and wife\}.

\. One day they went to wander around for fun \{in/toward\} the forest.

\. Having roamed around a good while they got to the forest, where they met up
with a bear.

\. This bear was very ferocious.

\. When it saw the two of them, it suddenly came running.

\. At this point the husband was scared stiff and went running into a cave.

\. Meanwhile the wife stayed at the mouth of the cave.

\. Now the wife was holding a rattan stick.

\. When the bear went at her, the wife took the rattan stick and thrust it into
its mouth, piercing it to death.

1\. Then, after it was dead, she called out to her husband, ``Come on out---it's
done\footnote{The Lahu here is \textit{šɨ ò} `has already died', with no subject expressed.}!'' she said.

1\. The husband said, ``Oh, it has bitten the woman, it's bitten the woman, it's
bitten the woman!'' he kept saying.

1\. ``Come on out---it's dead,'' she said, while he just kept saying ``It's bitten
the woman!''

1\. Well, after a certain time he came out, and said to his wife, ``Now then, woman,
tell people that I was the one who killed it!'', \footnote{Lit. ``do [as if] I got him with a shot.''} he said.

1\. Then the wife said, ``Cock your crossbow and shoot the mountain goat!'', she
said.

1\. So he cocked his crossbow and got off a shot at the mountain goat.

1\. When he fired the shot, it went too low, and didn't strike the body.

16-A.\footnote{This sentences was added by JAM (4/29/12) for clarity:} But this mountain goat was already very old, and when he heard the sound
of the shot he was terrified and suddenly died.

1\. When he fired off his crossbow, the husband said, ``Aha, it's dead!''

1\. But when they took a look, [they saw that the arrow/shot/bolt] did not strike
its body, but was stuck someplace below it.

18-A. \footnote{The rest of this text has also been added for clarity.} ``Look, woman!''

18-B. You see what a great marksman I am! \footnote{Lit. ``How skillful I am at shooting animals!''}

18-C. Even though I didn't hit him with my shot, the animal died, didn't you see!'',
he said.
