1 Once upon a time a dog and a pig were working together.

2 One day while the dog was working, the pig was not working but was just sleeping
under a big log.

3 The dog was diligently working.

4 The two of them quarreled and the pig got there [to their master's presence]
first and said, ``The dog is not working today. He's just lying under a big log.''

5 After a while the dog also got there.

6 The dog said, ``Today the pig is not working!'', he told him.

7 One day while the two of them were working the owner came to have a look, and
he saw that the pig was not working but the dog was.

8 For this reason, up until the present day, pigs have to stay under the veranda
and they're only fed chaff.

9 But dogs are fed nice white rice on top of the veranda.
