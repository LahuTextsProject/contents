\textbf{\#140 The Pig and the Dog (YL)}

1 Once upon a time a dog and a pig were working together.

2 One day while the dog and the pig were [supposed to be] working, the pig was
not working but was just sleeping under a big log.

3 The dog was diligently working.

4 The two of them \footnote{Since these animals are thoroughly anthropomorphized, here the classifier for people is used instead of the one for animals.} quarreled and the pig got back home first [to their master's
presence] and said, ``The dog is not working today. He's just lying under a big
log.''

5 After a while the dog also returned.

6 This time it was the dog's turn to tell him,  ``Today the pig is not working!''.

7 One day while the two of them were [supposed to be] working the owner came to
have a look, and he saw that the pig was not working but the dog was.

8 For this reason, up until the present day, pigs have to stay under the veranda
and they're only fed chaff.

9 But dogs are fed nice white rice on top of the veranda.
