204 Rite of Divorce

1 This evening these two people divorce, they break up.

2 Great Ruler, pure Ruler here at this place,\footnote{Addressed to the guardian spirit of the locality.} I bring for you these beautiful
beeswax candles made by my own hands; with the lighting of these two candles, the
marriage is dissolved; let neither party suffer misfortune.

3 We people do not break up this couple, they themselves break up.

4 Today we of this community give you these beautiful beeswax candles made by our
hands; the village fine has been exacted.

5 If the man wishes the divorce, the man must pay the fine; if the woman wishes
the divorce, the woman must pay the fine.

6 Let all the villagers witness that these two people break up, let the whole community
today witness that this couple divorce, they break up; you elders and young people
and all your children, witness that this marriage is dissolved.

7 It is dissolved! It is dissolved!
