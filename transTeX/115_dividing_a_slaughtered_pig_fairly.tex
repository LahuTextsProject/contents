{115 Dividing a Slaughtered Pig Fairly}

{ŠÁ-to-dō Village}

{1. Now I'd just like to tell you all about how the folks in ŠÁ-to-dō
used to slaughter a pig to eat.}

{2. Tell us until we're satisfied!}

{3. Well, then, as for slaughtering pigs, we also just recently killed one.
Today when we killed another one there were a few parts that we didn't divide up
among us, so some people are probably angry.}

{4. That's right. A while ago a person took some pork and went home with
it, but then I saw him bring it back again.}

{5. That guy was not happy about it.}

{6. He wasn't satisfied.}

{7. Hey, I'm not satisfied either!}

{8. We shouldn't do it that way. We ought to divide it up fairly to eat.}

{9. Even with the one that we slaughtered the other day, the butcher took
the intestines all for himself. The head too. Even the skin was gone. Just the
bones. I saw him take half of the head.}

{10. How many people are there who don't agree?}

{11. Three people.}

{12. That's a lot, that's a lot!}

{13. That is a lot---those who don't agree.}

{14. Yeah, so if you're not happy about it you should have said something
to us before now. Since you didn't say anything we can't do anything about it now.
Now there aren't even any intestines left. They've all been eaten up.}

{15. But they---the police---told us to divide it up fairly! [3]}

{16. Yes, but the insides and the head are for whoever does the slaughtering
to eat!}

{17. From today on we'll definitely divide up the intestines, the innards,
and the head also!}

{18. Never mind what we do from today onwards---right now you didn't tell
us that, so it's all your fault.}

{19. That's right! About their saying ``Divide it up fairly!'' when I heard
what they said to us, I disagree with you a little bit. [4]}

{20. If you guys aren't satisfied, if things aren't according to your wishes,
why didn't you say anything when that animal was slaughtered without dividing up
the intestines?}

{21. When you say that now it's too late.}

{22. So in the future, if we're able to get another one, just divide it
up equally to eat, every single part!}

{23. If you just keep quarreling about it, in the future you won't get anything
to eat, you guys.}

{24. If we quarrel like this, when it reaches the ears of the police we
won't get anything to eat anymore, in the future!}

{25. Oh, let's just stop worrying about this. Even if one or two people
aren't satisfied, most people are still perfectly happy with it.}

{26. I wonder how much there is [28] to eat in the innards and the head?}

{27. Well, it doesn't amount to very much.}

{28. As for the head, there's not even any meat on it.}

{29. As far as the feet go, we should chop them into small pieces and mix
them up thoroughly with the rest of the meat.}

{30. If you guys aren't satisfied, go ask anybody you want! [6] I don't
care.}

{31. On the head there's nothing to eat. Look over there at the one on the
storage-rack. There isn't even any skin on it.}

{32. Wherever you make me ask, I'll ask.}

{33. From now on, you guys can be the ones to do the butchering! We're not
going to kill them anymore.}

{34. We won't do it anymore. Starting from today. Even if we do get another
one to eat.}

{35. Now we }{\textit{won't}}{ get any more to eat.}

{36. Let those who aren't satisfied do it next time, fairly. This time we
managed to do a job that we didn't want to do. We made a mistake. Since we didn't
do it right, you guys aren't satisfied.}

{<A pause>}

{37. I bet you can't even divide up the intestines!}

{38. Each person would get such a short piece, if we divide it up.}

{39. We can't do it with so many people!}

{40. So we wouldn't even get enough to make }{\textit{nÁam phrík}}{.
