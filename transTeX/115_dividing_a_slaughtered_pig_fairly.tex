115 Dividing a Slaughtered Pig Fairly

ŠÁ-to-dō Village

\. Now I'd just like to tell you all about how the folks in ŠÁ-to-dō used to
slaughter a pig to eat.

\. Tell us until we're satisfied! \footnote{Emendation of text from \textbf{qôʔ mā qha ni ɛ̀ʔ} to \textbf{qôʔ}

\. Well, then, as for slaughtering pigs, we also just recently killed one. Today
when we killed another one there were a few parts that we didn't divide up among
us, so some people are probably angry.

\. That's right. A while ago a person took some pork and went home with it, [but]
then I saw him bring it back again.

\. That guy was not happy about it.

\. He wasn't \{happy/ satisfied\}.

\. Hey, I'm not satisfied either!

\. We shouldn't do it that way. We ought to divide it up fairly to eat.

\. Even with the one that we slaughtered the other day, the butcher took the intestines
all for himself. The head too. Even the skin was gone. Just the bones. I saw him
take half of the head [over in this direction]. \footnote{This parenthesized phrase is a wordy attempt to translate the verb-particle}

1\. How many people are there who don't agree?

1\. Three people.

1\. That's a lot, that's a lot!

1\. That is a lot---those who don't agree.

1\. Yeah, so if you're not happy about it you should have said something to us
before now. Since you didn't say anything we can't do anything about it now. Now
there aren't even any intestines left. They've all been eaten up.

1\. But they---the police---told us to divide it up fairly! \footnote{The pig in question was supposedly donated to the village by a local squad}

1\. Yes, but the insides and the head are for whoever does [the slaughtering] to
eat!

1\. From today \{onwards/ on\} we'll definitely divide up the intestines, the innards,
and the head also!

1\. \{Never mind! So what! Who cares!\} What we do from today onwards---\{right
now/ this time\} you didn't tell us that, so it's all your fault.

1\. That's right! About their saying ``Divide it up fairly!'' when I heard what
they said to us, I disagree with you a little bit. \footnote{I.e., about the interpretation of the policeman's admonition}

2\. If you guys aren't satisfied, if things aren't according to your wishes, why
didn't you say anything when \{that animal was slaughtered/ we slaughtered that
animal\} without dividing up the intestines?

2\. When you \{speak up/ say that\} now \{it's too late/ there's no time anymore\}.

2\. So in the future, if we're able to get another one [pig], just divide it up
\{equally/ fairly\} to eat, every single part!

2\. If you just keep quarreling about it, in the future you won't get anything
to eat, you guys.

2\. If we quarrel like this, when it reaches (``enters'') the ears of the police
we won't get anything to eat anymore, in the future!

2\. Oh, let's just stop worrying about this. Even if one or two people aren't satisfied,
most people are still \{OK/ perfectly happy\} with it.

2\. I wonder how much there is (``it goes'') [to eat] in the innards and the head?

2\. Well, it doesn't amount to very much.

2\. As for the head, there's not even any meat on it.

2\. As far as the feet go, [we should] chop them into small pieces and mix them
up thoroughly with the rest of the meat. \footnote{`thoroughly' translates the Vv \textbf{pə̀} `finish V'ing; V to a conclusion'.}

3\. If you guys aren't satisfied, go as anybody you want! \footnote{``Where you want to ask, go ask!'' I.e., other people will vouch for the fairness} I don't care.

3\. On the head there's nothing to eat. Look over there at the one [put] on the
storage-rack. There isn't even any skin on it.

3\. Wherever you make me ask, I'll ask.

3\. From now on, you guys can be the ones to kill [the pigs]! We're not going to
kill them anymore.

3\. We won't do it anymore. Starting from today. Even if we do get another one
to eat.

3\. Now we won't get any more to eat.

3\. Let those who aren't satisfied do it next time, fairly. This time we managed
to do a job that we didn't want to do. We made a mistake. Since we didn't do it
right, you guys aren't satisfied.

[A pause]

3\. I bet [we you] can't even divide up the intestines!

3\. Each person would get such a short piece---if we divide it up.

3\. We can't do it with so many people!

4\. So we wouldn't even get enough to make \textit{nÁam phrík}. \footnote{A spicy condiment made of salty fish sauce, hot peppers, and bits of vegetables}

4\. \{We just might/ I suppose we could\} use it to wind around a knife-sheath
