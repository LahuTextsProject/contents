205 Funerary Chants I

1 Oh! Oh! This man departs for Pū-phā-ša-phā's country.

2 Ah! He is separated from his wife and his children and from all his animals;
these two, husband and wife, are now separated, he lives in Pū-phā-ša-phā's
country.

3 Ah! From today and hereafter let him, and his wife and children not seek one
another.

4 You\footnote{The first part of the chant appears to be addressed to the surviving villagers, but at this juncture the officiating specialist begins to address the deceased's ɔ̀-ha directly.} are not the same as you were before, so go and live in Pū-phā-ša-phā's
country.

5 Now, from today and hereafter, your wife works in the fields like everyone else,
she lives here with a new husband,\footnote{This lie is supposed to encourage the deceased's ɔ̀-ha to leave, as he will now want to find a new wife in the land of the dead.} so let her live as she lived before.\footnote{That is, ``Unlike you, she is not a spirit; do not try to take her with you to the land of the dead.''}

6 You have become a spirit, so when you go to Pū-phā-ša-phā's country, go
carefully, and there carefully look for and marry a new wife.

7 You are not as you were before, so look for and marry a new wife over there.

8 Your wife and children are here, let your wife marry someone from here; she does
not disrespect you, she does not disobey you, for you must go away and over there
in Pū-phā-ša-phā's country you must look for and marry a new wife.

9 You are not as you were before; from today and hereafter, when you go, go carefully;
do not trouble your wife, your children, nor your animals which you have left behind
you; allow them to live here.

10 You go and seek [a new family and new livestock] in Pū-phā-ša-phā's country,
Oh go, go carefully!
