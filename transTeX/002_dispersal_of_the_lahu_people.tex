2 Dispersal of the Lahu People

\. Now I'd like to tell you a little bit about our Lahu customs and traditions.

\. We Lahu people live in the hills and earn our living by cultivating paddy fields
and opium fields.

\. Sometimes we also go hunting for food to eat.

\. So the Lahu people live in the hills and are not people who are idle.\footnote{Lit. \texttt{"}people who do nothing\texttt{"}.}

\. Sometimes we also go into the towns and do a little bit of trading.

\. In any case, there is not really a country for the Lahu people.

\. The so-called \texttt{"}Lahu people\texttt{"}, whichever country they end up
in, they become that country's citizens.

\. For example, the Lahu who live in China become Chinese people, the Lahu people
who live in Burma become Burmese people (from then on).

\. The people who live in Thailand are the same way.

1\. Having come to live in Thailand, soon they will get to be Thai people.

1\. So, there is not really a Lahu country.

1\. That's what I think.
