{\textbf{\#30 The Blind Men and the Elephant}}

{\textit{<edited by JAM, 7/1/16>}}

{1. Once upon a time there was a great big white elephant.}

{2. This great elephant was tethered outside of a house.}

{3. While it was tethered there, there were several blind people inside
the house.[1]}

{4. These people, one after the other, went and touched it.}

{5. When the first person touched it, he happened to touch a tusk, so he
said, ``What we call an elephant is as sharp and pointed as a knife!''}

{6. He went back in, and the chief clerk [2] wrote it down in his book.}

{7. When they sent the second man [to check out the elephant], since he
happened to touch around its ribs, he said, ``It's like a fenced-off wall!'', and
the scribe wrote it down.}

{8. One opinions, two opinions, a third opinion---when they sent out the
third person, he happened to touch a leg, so he said, ``The so-called elephant
has a giant bulging place like a tree-trunk, and a flat foot.``}

{9. When they sent out the fourth person he happened to touch the elephant's
tail, so he said, ``Oh, this so-called elephant is like a rope!``
}

{10. So they argued and argued with each other all day long.}

{11. All these different opinions were because each of the blind men happened
to touch a different place, so all these different opinions resulted.}
