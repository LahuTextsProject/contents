89 We Sinners are Like Pigs

Sermon by Pastor David in ŠÁtodū vilage, 1965

\. Woman: Don't laugh! Be quiet!

\. Another person: Don't laugh! If you talk now it'll be recorded!\footnote{Chi bə̀ʔ te a qo lòʔ e ve yâ: lit. ``if you do it now it will go in!''}

\. Pastor David: Once upon a time there was a certain wealthy man.\footnote{\{cut off in copy\}}

\. And he had one pig.

\. This sow was called Miss Blackie.\footnote{na-nâʔ: na- (Bn) `prefix to female names', nâʔ (N; Mpfx) `black'}

\. So one day when she came back after bathing in a mud-hole, when her owner saw
her, when he looked at all that mud, it wasn't good, so he took her and washed
away all that mud from her \footnote{í-kâʔ chɨ̂ bà pî: ``washed away with water for her benefit.''}, and made the sparkling clean.

\. Then when he let her go again he said to her, ``From now on, don't bathe in
mud any more again!'', the owner said.

\. So after he let her go, she \{saw/found\} a mud-hole again and took a bath again
in the water---er, I mean the \textit{mud-hole}.\footnote{The verb hɛ́ `bathe' almost always occurs with the specifying noun \textbf{í-kâʔ}}

\. But the owner's \{mercy/love/concern\}\footnote{hàʔ-qÁ: 1st syll. \texttt{<} Shan \textbf{hak} `love' (cf. Si. \textbf{rÁk})} towards her was not exhausted yet.

1\. On this matter there is something in the Bible.

1\. While all human beings are wallowing in sin,\footnote{vên-bÁ ɔ̀-qhɔ lo šɨ chɛ̂ ve: šɨ `die' can be used metaphorically} the Lord Jesus Christ has great
compassion for all sinners, and therefore with His blood he washes away all sins.

1\. For he says, ``\{Henceforth/From now on\} let no one sin again!''---thus he
says.

1\. However, all of us human beings do not \{listen to/heed\} the words of Jesus,
so we continue to sin in the future.

1\. However, Jesus' love for all of humanity is \{boundless/infinite\}.

1\. He is always waiting for them to repent their bad actions and return to him.

1\. Therefore that mud-hole means\footnote{qôʔ gâ ve: ``want to say,'' i.e., `mean', like Fr. \textit{vouloir dire},} the sins of all of you!

1\. As for the water, that means the blood of Jesus.

1\. May all Christians who have been washed in the blood of Jesus remember what
Jesus said: ``From today onward, do not sin again!''
