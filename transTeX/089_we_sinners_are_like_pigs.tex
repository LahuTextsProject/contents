89 We Sinners are Like Pigs

Sermon by Pastor David in ŠÁtodū vilage, 1965

1. Woman: Don't laugh! Be quiet!

2. Another person: Don't laugh! If you talk now it'll be recorded!\footnote{Chi bə̀ʔ te a qo lòʔ e ve yâ: lit. ``if you do it now it will go in!''   now    do Pv if go in Pv NOM Excl}

3. Pastor David: Once upon a time there was a certain wealthy man.\footnote{\{cut off in copy\}}

4. And he had one pig.

5. This sow was called Miss Blackie.\footnote{na-nâʔ: na- (Bn) `prefix to female names', nâʔ (N; Mpfx) `black'}

6. So one day when she came back after bathing in a mud-hole, when her owner saw
her, when he looked at all that mud, it wasn't good, so he took her and washed
away all that mud from her \footnote{í-kâʔ chɨ̂ bà pî: ``washed away with water for her benefit.''  water Vn Vv Vv  wash away benefactive}, and made the sparkling clean.

7. Then when he let her go again he said to her, ``From now on, don't bathe in
mud any more again!'', the owner said.

8. So after he let her go, she \{saw/found\} a mud-hole again and took a bath again
in the water---er, I mean the \textit{mud-hole}.\footnote{The verb hɛ́ `bathe' almost always occurs with the specifying noun \textbf{í-kâʔ} `water', so the speaker lets the word `water' slip out before correcting himself.}

9. But the owner's \{mercy/love/concern\}\footnote{hàʔ-qÁ: 1st syll. < Shan \textbf{hak} `love' (cf. Si. \textbf{rÁk})} towards her was not exhausted yet.

10. On this matter there is something in the Bible.

11. While all human beings are wallowing in sin,\footnote{vên-bÁ ɔ̀-qhɔ lo šɨ chɛ̂ ve: šɨ `die' can be used metaphorically to mean `persist in a wretched state'. See DL: 1232.  sin      inside Prt die PROG} the Lord Jesus Christ has great
compassion for all sinners, and therefore with His blood he washes away all sins.

12. For he says, ``\{Henceforth/From now on\} let no one sin again!''---thus he
says.

13. However, all of us human beings do not \{listen to/heed\} the words of Jesus,
so we continue to sin in the future.

14. However, Jesus' love for all of humanity is \{boundless/infinite\}.

15. He is always waiting for them to repent their bad actions and return to him.

16. Therefore that mud-hole means\footnote{qôʔ gâ ve: ``want to say,'' i.e., `mean', like Fr. \textit{vouloir dire}, Bse. \textbf{pyô tšĩ te}, etc.  V   Pv  NOM                 V    Pv  NOM} the sins of all of you!

17. As for the water, that means the blood of Jesus.

18. May all Christians who have been washed in the blood of Jesus remember what
Jesus said: ``From today onward, do not sin again!''
