1. Now I would like to sing a little song about how we go hunting. Please listen
well.

2. Saturday is the day for us Lahu to go hunting.

3. The biggest joy for us Lahu is hunting day.

4. Each and every man carries his crossbow and gun, and leading his dogs he goes
into the jungle.

5. No matter how high the mountain, no matter how overgrown, he goes off in joy
and gladness.

6. When he arrives in the jungle the hunter, leading his dogs, diligently chases
after all kinds of porcupines\footnote{\textbf{fâʔ-pu-fâʔ-pɛ́}: \textbf{fâʔ-pu} 'Asiatic porcupine'\textit{ [Hystrix brachyura}]; \textbf{fâʔ-pɛ́} 'brush-tailed porcupine' \textit{[Atherurus macrourus]}.}, sambar deer, and barking deer.

7. No matter how much strength he has to expend, for him it is a pleasure.

8. Listen, listen! The dogs are making a racket as they chase.\footnote{\textbf{qha-pâʔ} is an intensifying verb particle used in situations where non-visual perception (esp. hearing or not hearing) is at issue.}

9. Let's go, let's go! Yellow Guy, Black Guy!\footnote{These male dogs' names begin with the prefix \textbf{cà}-, while the female dogs' names begin with the prefix \textbf{na}-. Cf. \textbf{ši} `yellow' and \textbf{nâʔ} `black'.} Let's go, let's go! Goldie, Blackie!
Let's go, let's go!

10. O hunters, the dogs are making a lot of noise, let's keep our eyes peeled!
