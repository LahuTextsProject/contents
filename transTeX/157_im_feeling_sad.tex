157 I'm feeling sad

Told in Red Lahu in a chanting style; the speaker was more than a bit tipsy, and
from Sentence 5 was chewing betel

\. Today I went to Na-lí a-a-and there were no friends the-e-ere, and I'm so sad
I could die.

\. Si-i-inging up there I we-e-nt, [but now] my heart is sa-a-ad and I'm going
to di-i-ie.

\. I went to Na-lí and came back, but no friends were the-e-re, and I feel so
cra-a-ppy \footnote{\textbf{chɛ̂ bɔ̀}: lit. ``be weary of living''} I could die.

\. I canme ho-o-me and put my stuff in the house, and went to take a dip in the
river.

\. I went into the wa-a-ater, and there was a young guy there---[INAUDIBLE]

\. It took two or three hours to go there [to Na-lí], and two or three hours to
come ba-a-ack, and I put [stuff] in the house---[but] I went up there, I went to
have a chat. [He lapses into incoherence]
