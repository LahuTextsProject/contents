1. Now I'd like to sing a courtship song sung by the young girls and young men.
Please listen!

2. Boy: Oh maid, when I don't see you my heat is so sad!

3. Girl: Oh youth, when I don't hear your voice, even my food is tasteless to me!

4. Boy: Oh maid, you are the fairest of them all!

5. Girl: Oh youth, you are also the handsomest of them all!

6. Boy: Oh maid, you are as beautiful as a young iridescent pá-kɛ̀-pa-câ!\footnote{A beautiful white fish that reflects rainbow hues. A kind of sucker, perhaps \textit{Osteochilus hasselti}. See DL: 802.}

7. Girl: Oh youth, you are also as handsome as a young banana flower!

8. That's the end of this Lahu song.
