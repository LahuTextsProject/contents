49 Granny \{Gets Smeared With/ Falls into the\} Mud (a modern song)

1. My brethren!  This little song is just about how ``Granny gets smeared with
mud''---it's just a little song.

2. Listen up now!  I'm going to sing!

SINGS: (To be retranslated metrically)

3. It's raining now, \{Granny/ Grandma\}!

4. Don't you see that it's raining?

5. \{Old grandpa/ the old man\} said to her, ``Don't go anywhere, grandma, you
\{hunchbacked woman/ woman with a crooked back\}!

6. Grandma didn't listen, and went out onto the veranda to scratch apart some rice
grains for drying.

7. She shipped and fell down into the mud .\footnote{The split bamboo floor of the veranda often buckles under one's weight if a false step is made, resulting in a slow descent into the mud under the house. (This happened to the author one morning as he was brushing his teeth on Cà-bo's veranda.  Trying not to laugh, Cà-bo led me to the stream to wash off.}

8. Her whole body was covered in mud .\footnote{jèʔ-nɛ́ tí phɛ̀ʔ šē-ò: lit. ``became only mud unfortunately.''}

9. Grandma cried, ``Alas, alas, and woe is me!'' \footnote{a-la-la-ôʔ, a-la-la-ôʔ, a-la-ɨ̄!}
