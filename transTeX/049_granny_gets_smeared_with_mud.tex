\textit{\textbf{<a modern song>}}

1. Brothers and sisters! This little song is about how ``Granny gets smeared with
mud''---it's just a little song.

2. Listen up now! I'm going to sing!

SINGS:

3. ``Grandma gets smeared with mud'':

4. It's raining now, Grandma!

5. Don't you see that it's raining?

6. Old grandpa said to her, ``Don't go anywhere, you hunchbacked old woman!''

7. Grandma didn't listen, and went out onto the veranda to scratch apart some rice
grains for drying.

8. She slipped and fell down into the mud.\footnote{The split bamboo floor of the veranda often buckles under one's weight if a false step is made, resulting in a slow descent into the mud under the house. (This happened to the author one morning in 1965, as he was brushing his teeth on Cà-bo's veranda. Trying not to laugh, \textbf{Cà-bo} led me to the stream to wash off.)}

9. Her whole body was covered in mud.\footnote{\textbf{jèʔ-nɛ́} \textbf{tí} \textbf{phɛ̀ʔ} \textbf{šē-ò}: lit. ``became only mud unfortunately.''}

10. Grandma cried, ``Alas, alas, and woe is me!''\footnote{\textbf{a-la-la-ôʔ}, \textbf{a-la-la-ôʔ}, \textbf{a-la-ɨ̄}!}
