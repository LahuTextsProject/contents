\. Don't you see that it's raining?

\. \{Old grandpa/ the old man\} said to her, ``Don't go anywhere, grandma, you
\{hunchbacked woman/ woman with a crooked back\}!

\. Grandma didn't listen, and went out onto the veranda to scratch apart some rice
grains for drying.

\. She shipped and fell down into the mud \footnote{The split bamboo floor of the veranda often buckles under one's weight if a}.

\. Her whole body was covered in mud \footnote{jèʔ-nɛ́ tí phɛ̀ʔ šē-ò: lit. ``became only mud unfortunately.''}.

\. Grandma cried, ``Alas, alas, and woe is me!'' \footnote{a-la-la-ôʔ, a-la-la-ôʔ, a-la-ɨ̄!}
