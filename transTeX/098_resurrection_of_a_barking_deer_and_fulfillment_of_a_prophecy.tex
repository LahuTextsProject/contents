98 Resurrection of a Barking Deer and Fulfillment of a Prophecy

[former title'' Barking Deer and Swallowed Berries, or He did it after all]

\. Once upon a time there was a married couple.\footnote{chɔ  tê  ca. The storyteller uses the singular 3p pronoun yɔ̂ in what follows}

\. They were very lazy.

\. They didn't work.

\. So day after day they just stayed home.

\. Well, one day came when they were getting hungry.

\. Since they were so hungry, they went off into the \{forest/jungle\} to dig for
yams to eat.

\. While they were off to dig for yams to eat, they found a barking deer \footnote{chɨ-pí-qwɛ̀ʔ: A small deer (\textit{Cervulus muntjac}; \textit{Muntiacus} that
had choked to death on a wild gooseberry!\footnote{qhâʔ-cÁ-šī: \textit{Sesbanea sesbans }or \textit{Phyllanthus emblica}.}

\. So then the two of them, husband and wife, carried the barking deer back home.

\. So they turned back and arrived home, and put it into a big basket for storing
\{rice/paddy\}, and set some water on the fire to boil.

1\. Meanwhile their children were playing around stroking the barking deer.

1\. The kids were saying, ``Are you the one that says \textbf{pé}? Are you the
one that says \textbf{pí}?,'' joking and playfully stroking it.

1\. Then all of a sudden what was \{choking it/caught in its throat\} was stroked
back into \footnote{This complex verbal idea (stroke back into) is conveyed by a three-verb concatenation:} it[s stomach], and it jumped up and ran away.

1\. So then this couple went to a fortune-teller \footnote{mɔ́ `teacher; master; expert; possessor of occult knowledge' \texttt{<} Tai} to ask a question.

1\. He \footnote{The pronoun is not expressed, but the context makes it clear that it is the} said to the fortune-teller, ``Oh, master, will I be able to get my animal
back, or won't I be able to get it back?,'' he asked.

15a. The fortune-teller said, ``Ah, that animal of yours you cannot get back.

15b. ``If you try to do so, you will just have to lick your wife's `thing'.''\footnote{\textbf{mɔ̂ }`thing' is here used as a euphemism. Cf. also the expression}

1\. At this he \{retorted/answered back\}, ``Oh, you miserable fortune-telling
sonofabitch!'',\footnote{\textbf{mɔ́-khì-mɔ́-tələ̂ʔ} (ElabN): N1 + khɨ̀ + N1 + tələ̂ʔ} and \{drove/chased\} him away.

1\. After this, when they reached a certain point [on their way home], rain came
pouring down, and they got drenched and were freezing.

1\. When they got back home, the husband and wife both sat down in front of the
tripod in the fireplace and warmed themselves by the fire.

1\. Then he caught sight of his wife's thing, and stuck a finger right inside,\footnote{\textbf{g̈ɔ̀ jûʔ phɛ̂}: \textbf{jûʔ} `stick in'; the prehead versatile}
and it disappeared in there. [When he took it out it was all wet, so] he wiped
it off on the tripod.

2\. When he wiped it off on the tripod, he [his finger] got bured, so he licked
it vigorously.

2\. Then all of a sudden he remembered.

2\. ``What the fortune-teller told me just now was true!'', he realized.
