{1 P: What I'd just like to know is, in a Lahu village how old do a young
man and a girl have to be before they can get married, would you say? Is there
a rule about that sort of thing? In other tribes' villages, everywhere, if you
haven't reached a certain age you can't get married, I hear. In some places you
can't take a wife until you're twenty years old. In other places you can't take
a husband until you're sixteen. Do you have rules like that? Or else can you even
get married when you're ten years old? Can you marry at whatever [age] you please,
would you say? }

{2 T: Well, as far as that goes, if you're ten years old you certainly can't
take a husband or a wife. Our Lahu custom is, that a woman who is fourteen or fifteen,
or a man who is seventeen or eighteen years old may marry. Besides that, there's
a rule that we Lahu have that goes like this. A man who is younger may even marry
a woman who is older, according to us. [But] if the man is older and the woman
is younger, they can't get married. That's what we say. And there's a Lahu proverb
to that effect. }

{3 P: <changing the subject> Well, then, there isn't anybody
who would be higher-up than the headman in our Lahu villages, is there? Other people,
like the Shans -- right? -- when we were in Shan State, [there were] the so-called
}{\textit{pukeh}}{, right? The ones above the }{\textit{pukeh}}{
were called }{\textit{pumyn}}{,[7] right? Those above the }{\textit{pumyn}}{
were called }{\textit{pusheh}}{,[8] isn't that so? And there were
still several kinds [of officials] above the }{\textit{pusheh}}{.
Are there such things among the Lahu? }

{4 T: Well, we Lahu don't really have that sort of thing. There is one thing
that we do have, though. There's one person who is higher up than all the headmen
-- er, than the headman and all the villagers put together. He is not the headman.
What we call him in Lahu is "the committee of one for our physical well-being."[10]
That person now, if there should be strife and disharmony in the village, if people
are quarreling and bickering with each other, he's the fellow that people have
to go to first. If this fellow can't decide the matter, one must go in to the headman.}

{5 P: So that fellow is higher-up than the headman, is that it?}

{6 T: If we're talking about the letter of the law,[12] he's the person
who's higher-up than the headman.}

{7 P: But he doesn't have to work like the headman does.}

{8 T: No, he doesn't. }

{9 P: He's just appointed to be an important person, right?}

{10 T: Yes, and he must only do good things.[14]}

{11 P: How do you choose this fellow? Do you pick him the way you pick a
headman?}

{12 T: Yes, both the headman and the villagers all have to [vote to] pick
him.}

{13 P: <changing the subject> Well, today we[15] have
come from the city here to this Lahu village to celebrate the New Rice Festival
together, and since we've been privileged to celebrate with you, we are really
and truly happy. We will never forget the way we have been able to celebrate [with
you]. And we're very grateful indeed. But, Pastor, could you please tell us a bit
about the customs and practices connected with the Lahu New Rice Festival? }

{14 T: Oh, I certainly can tell you about it. The way we Christian Lahu
celebrate New Rice it's not at all the same as those pagan[16] Red[17] Lahu do
it out there. This is how the pagans do it. When they celebrate New Rice, they
bring all their hoes and knives and put them together in one place, and prepare
food and drink, and offer it to the hoes and knives. The reason is, that it is
thanks to these tools that we get our food and drink, so they say. But it's different
with all us Christians. We get our food and drink because God takes pity on all
of us human beings on earth, and cares for us day after day, and helps us. Furthermore,
while we live upon the earth, God blesses the land[21] with fertility in order
that our physical natures may be nourished. And since we know it is because He
moistens the earth with rain that the rice-seeds we human beings have planted send
forth their sprouts, and because He has put His powers inside the seeds and seedpods,
we praise the grace of God. For this reason, it is a very great joyous occasion
for us all.}

{15 P: Oh, so when the pagans -- the "beeswax-burners"[25]
-- celebrate the New Rice, they say it's thanks to the various hoes and knives
that we get rice to eat, so they offer thanks to their tools and praise them, is
that it? But we say that we are nourished because of God -- the grace of God --
so we praise God and give thanks to Him, and that's the difference between us,
right? }

{16 T: Yes, that's how we're different. }

{17 P: Well, don't other people like the Northern Thai or the Shan have
one too, a New-Rice celebration? Haven't you ever heard whether they do or not?
}

{18 T: Well, I myself haven't been in Thailand -- in Northern Thai country
-- for very long yet, so I'm really not sure. But my guess is that they probably
don't have the custom of celebrating the New Rice. What we do know about is the
Red Lahu and the Karen, and that's all we know. The people called "Karen"
have similar customs. When the pagans among them[29] celebrate the New Rice, they
prepare food and drink for their hoes and knives and for the spirits and false
gods[30] that they depend on, and after they've offered it to them they celebrate
the New Rice. They say that those idols of theirs help them! }

{19 P: Hm, I don't really understand what }{\textit{šÁ-hòʔ-šÁ-nÁ}}{
means in Lahu, so could you please explain its meaning to me? What do you mean
by }{\textit{šÁ-hòʔ-šÁ-nÁ}}{? }

{20 T: The thing we call }{\textit{šÁ-hòʔ-šÁ-nÁ }}{is
like this. Way back at the time when our Lord Jesus was born on earth, he too ---
that is, the man who preached about the }{\textit{šÁ-hòʔ-šÁ-nÁ}}{
--- was also born at that time. This man went off to the east. He went to preach
his doctrine of the }{\textit{šÁ-hòʔ-šÁ-nÁ}}{, while Jesus
went preaching to the west. So as he went around preaching and preaching at that
time, the words this fellow taught were quite good. He would say, "If
you want to reach the kingdom of God, do upright and righteous deeds even as I
do,'' thus he would preach. Well, after he had done his preaching, this fellow
died. When he had died, his successors, a group of people, set the fellow up as
a god, and made images and pictures[32] of him which they bowed down to.[33] We
call them }{\textit{šÁ-hòʔ-šÁ-nÁ}}{ because they were made
by human beings.[34]}

{21 P: Oh, I see, I see. Well, since you arrived in Thailand how many times
has it come to now that you've been celebrating the New Rice Festival, if you count
this time too?}

{22 T: Well, if you count this time, we've been celebrating the New Rice
in Thailand now for eleven[37] years! Eleven years.}

{23 P: Rather a long time now, isn't it?}

{24 T: Mm, quite a long time now! }

{25 P: Ah, it's a tremendous joy for us Lahu, isn't it, that through the
grace of God we've been able to celebrate the New Rice Festival properly year after
year! }

{26 T: Yes, indeed.}

{27 P: How is it that you do this "celebration of the New Rice"?
Is it as we saw today, that you slaughter pigs and chickens and in joy and gladness
pray to God together and eat? Is that right, do you celebrate that way every year?
}

{28 T: Yes, that's right. Some years we have plenty to eat and drink, and
we must praise the grace of God the more.[39] Other years, since we Lahu hill-tribesmen
are poor and needy folk, we don't have anything to eat, no curry[40] or meat to
go with our rice, but even so everybody contributes whatever he may have and we
kill a few chickens, we kill them and eat them together in joy and gladness and
praise the goodness of God. }

{29 P: So do the "beeswax-burners" also kill chickens
and pigs like that and cook them happily, the way we do? If we just consider the
matter of what they eat, their eating.[41]}

{30 T: As far as what they eat goes, it's the same. But it's just that they
make their offerings differently. As for their eating, after they worship their
idols, their spirits, their hoes and knives, they all eat together. }

{31 P: Well, talking here with you now, I've learned what I wanted to know
about the celebration of the New Rice Festival, the way the Lahu celebrate the
New Rice Festival, and I'm really grateful to you. Thank you very much indeed.
Now I still have a little bit more that I'd like to know about the Lahu, so could
I ask some more, Pastor?}

{32 T: You can ask.}

{33 P: Pastor, as you now, people who live in the mountains like the Lahu,
the Akha, the Lisu, the Wa, the Hmong, they're called "hill-people,"
right? While people like the Shans, the Burmans, the Northern Thai are called "plains-people,"
right? Well, how is it that it's turned out that there are people who live in the
plains and people who live in the mountains? }

{34 T: Well, it's this way. Long ago our Lahu race, in the days of our forefathers,
a time long ago, we have a Lahu legend[47] about this. This Lahu legend of ours
goes like this. It is said that one day one of our Lahu forefathers was climbing
up a mountain. He was climbing a certain very high mountain. He packed a water-tube[49]
and carried it on his back as he climbed. Well, he went on and on, and climbed
and climbed, and before he had wound his way up to the middle of the mountain,
when he reached the middle, his water gave out. For this reason, all of us Lahu
go to live on mountaintops, or so this Lahu legend has it.[51]}

{35 P: You mean he got up onto the mountain and his water gave out, so he
wasn't able to come back down again?}

{36 T: Yes.}

{37 P: Oh. Well then, how is it that all these plains-dwellers like the
Shans and the Northern Thai live in the flatlands, would you say?}

{38 T: Well, those people now, about the Northern Thai we --- we Lahu ---
don't really know very much about such matters. Do }{\textit{you}}{
know? }

{39 P: All that I know, you see, about the Shans and the Wa, you know[52]
-- I once did hear something about the Wa! They say that once upon a time the Wa
were plainsmen! The Lahu, the Wa, the Akha were all people who lived in the plains,
they say. I don't really know whether it's true or not though, you see. I heard
some old men talking about it, and they said that the Wa once--that the Wa and
the Lahu and all the hill-people once lived in the plains. The Shans used to live
in "the-mountains-and-the-valleys,''[69] they said. But the Shans were
a lot smarter! They realized that they were having a terrible hard time living
off their dry-rice fields up in the hills, so they said to the plains-living Wa--to
some Wa and Lahu, "Say, come on up and live in the mountains! You can
earn a living with opium fields in the mountains, you can get a living from all
sorts of things, and there's a lot of silver, too. And there are plenty of game-animals
and lots of room for dry-rice fields besides. But in the plains there's no game,
there's nothing!" they said. "So you plains-people have no wealth,
no means of livelihood, none of these various ways to make a living."
Well, the Lahu and [the other present-day] hill-people [like] the Wa thought this
was the truth, so they changed places. They switched with the others: ``So we shall
go up and live in the mountains, and you people come live in the plains,"
they're supposed to have said. So they went and switched around! That's how the
people who now live up in the hills came to live there.[56] And the Shans and the
Northern Thai and all the rest of them came to live in the plains, and they turned
out the way they did! }

{40 T: Oh, is that what they said?}

{41 P: That's right.}

{42 T: It was really very good of you to retell this story to us.}

{43 P: Somehow or other, nowadays many of the plains-people are making a
fine living from their wet-rice fields, and are doing very well in trading, so
they're coming up in the world[57] day by day. The hill-folk cultivate swiddens.
But the hill-people are very badly off, whether from their dry-rice fields or anything
else they try to earn a living from. So no matter how many different things they
think up, no matter what plans they may think up to get ahead in the world, they
have no time.[58] And so day after day they suffer in poverty. There is no way
for them to improve themselves like other people. That's how it goes. So now one
can't see how these so-called "hill-tribesmen" will ever be able
to find a way to work themselves up. }

{44 T: Oh, that's absolutely right! These Lahu words, the things those Lahu
elders said, are absolutely right. Ah, it's disgusting to think of those Lahu ancestors
of ours![60]}

{45 P: Yes, yes, yes. These Shans, they used to live up in the mountains,
and they had a wretched living from their dry-rice fields and from everything else.
But these people like the Lahu and the Wa and the Akha had no education. The Shans
and the Northern Thai had oily tongues,[61] so the others[62] went flying up into
the mountains! They switched around, they exchanged their lands. They changed their
habitat. Now they're very clever, more than we are. Oh, in all respects! They're
coming up in the world, I tell you.}

{46 T: Well, then, I for one don't know what has to be done now for our
Lahu people to find a way to improve themselves. Do you know the answer to that,
too?[65]}

{47 P: Well, as far as I can see, in order for the hill-people to raise
their standard of living I don't even say they've got to go live in the plains.
Even up in the mountains there are certain places where you can make wet-rice fields--live
off wet-rice fields--or off fruit-orchards of various kinds. So if you go about
it properly I think you could probably find a way to prosper like other people,
like the people living in the plains. Then too the Lahu just[67] don't have any
education, they just haven't managed to get schooling like other people. So since
they don't understand the ways and means of getting ahead, why, I think there's
probably no way they can actually do it. But in the future if the Lahu also come
to have education and training, if in their hearts they come to desire it, to want
to seek it, then someday I suppose it will be possible. However, if I were to say
what would really be best, I think that the best thing would be to go live in the
plains and live off wet-rice fields or anything else. It would certainly be easier!
}

{48 T: Well, so we should probably go look at the places where there is
flat land for wet-rice fields. }

{49 P: Yes, yes, everybody ought to go and look, each one of you. As we've
come to realize, even if we live and work for a living in the hills for a hundred
years, or for a thousand years or more, there will never be a year when we'll get
to see any improvement in our lot, right? It's that way the first year. It's that
way the second year. It's that way for a hundred years. That's just the way it
is! The plains-people over there from one year to the next get to ride in cars,
and after the cars come airplanes, and when the airplanes come so do their big
beautiful houses--all kinds of things happen for them. That's just the way it is!
On the intellectual side too they're making progress! So if we think it over now,
and manage to live in the plains as we should, I really think we'll probably begin
to see the path to progress. }

{50 T: Ah, they're absolutely right, these words of yours. }
