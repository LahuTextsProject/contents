\textbf{19 Song: \texttt{"}We are Rising Up!\texttt{"}}

[Tape II, Side 1 \#10]

1 Rise up, all of us!

2 Lift yourselves up,[1] let us unite our hearts[2]!

3 In this old, in this ancient city

4 We shall dwell in bliss for ever and ever[3].

5 Our happiness no mouth can fully utter, none can fully utter!
