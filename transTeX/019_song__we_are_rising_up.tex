\textbf{\#19 Song: ``Let Us Rise Up!``}

1 Let us rise up, all of us!

2 Rise up,  with united hearts!  \footnote{. \textbf{ni-ma tê šī tí tā}: lit. ``making one's heart single'', i.e., 'be united in feeling or purpose; be constant, not fickle'.}

3 In this old, in this ancient city,

4 We shall dwell in bliss for ever and ever .\footnote{\textbf{ chi-co-qɔ̂-tāy}: lit. ``ten generations, nine eras.''}

5 Our happiness no mouth can fully utter, none can fully utter!
