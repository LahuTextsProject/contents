Conversation among Paul Tcalo (Cà-lɔ̂) ``P'', Thû-yì (T-y), Pastor Cà-bo
(T for ``teacher'')

Répliques 1-48; 49-78 ``The Lahu Agricultural Cycle''

1. P: Well, this group of Lahu of yours living in Huey Tat, how many years has
it been since you arrived in Thailand?

2. T-y: Well, this year makes about 12 years since we arrived here in Thailand,
I guess.\footnote{``I guess'' translates hɛ́ (Pnf)}

3. P: When you came down \footnote{yàʔ la ve: the villages' previous home in Shan State was evidently at a higher} here what month was it? Did you come down in the cold
season or in the hot season?

4. T-y: Well, as for the time, I don't really know! I was still a kid then, you
know.

5. P: How old were you then? When you came down here.

6. T-y: Hmm, I must have been only about ten years old.

7. P: When you came down then, how many days did you have to spend the night \{on
the road/by the roadside\}?

8. T-y: Wow, from when we started to flee from up there until we arrived here in
Thailand, it took about a month, more or less.

9. P: When you arrived in Thailand, what did you do at first to earn a living?
To support your wives and children? And to support yourselves? To keep body and
soul together?\footnote{ɔ-to hu tù: ``in order to nourish the body.''}

10. T: The year that we got here, we \{worked/survived by working\} for hire\footnote{tha-ŋâ ve `work for hire' [not a traditional Lahu activity] \texttt{<} Thai}
for the ``Big Boss.''\footnote{ša-thê ló: owner of a large plantation near Huey Tat.} For one day's work five and a half baht. And as for food
and drink, the Big Boss helped us out with everything.

11. P: What sort of work did you do to earn a living with the Big Boss?

12. T-y: Oh, we did all kinds of work. We'd weed the ten gardens and loosen [the
earth at] the base of the plants with a hoe.\footnote{qɔ̂ g̈âʔ ve: ``hoe-scratch'', here translated ``loosen with a hoe''} We'd do all that kind of stuff.

13. P: That year you hadn't yet begun to cultivate \{mountain fields/swiddens\}?

14. T-y: Ah, the year that we came here to live we didn't cultivate yet. All we
did was work for hire.

15. T: That year we didn't cultivate swiddens yet. The year we got here we worked
for the Big Boss, a day's worth at a time \footnote{tê ni pu tê ni, i.e., from hand to mouth}---for a whole year we only did that
kind of work to \{survive/eat\}.

16. P: So working for him that way, with the money the Big Boss gave you, you bought
rice to eat?

17. T-y: Well, as far as rice goes, we didn't have to buy it to eat then! He fed
us. Both curries and rice, everything.

18. P: So how may years did you work that way for the Big Boss? In other words,
how long did you have to earn your living that way?

19. T: We worked for the Big Boss like that for the whole year that we arrived---by
the second year we had cleared fields, and were living by cultivating swiddens.
Besides, [even] after we had managed to \{feed ourselves/earn our living\}, working
for hire was still a way for us to get some money.

20. P: Besides cultivating the swiddens, what other things did/do you do? Are/were
there all kinds of other things like raising pigs and chickens?

21. T-y: Oh, we do/did all kinds of things. By raising pigs and chickens, and selling
the pigs and chickens, we get a little extra money, as we keep on doing it, and
we get a little bit for it.

22. P: Now what I'd just like to know, your cultivating swiddens, clearing land
for swiddens---what rules and regulations are there by the Thai government, the
Thai authorities,\footnote{P. uses both the Burmese (acúyàʔ) and Thai (lâthâbân) words for `government'.} how have they laid them down?

23. T: So for our cultivating fields here in Thailand nowadays, the Thai --- the
authorities have issued a command that land cannot be cleared for swiddens. However,
since we live on \textit{nikhom}\footnote{A Thai government hill-tribe resettlement center. Lahu nîʔ-kho \texttt{<}} land, we are allowed to cultivate a little
bit. But even though we can manage to earn a living that way, there are still very
troublesome things. \{For example/That is\}, the police come up here \{all the
time/frequently\}, and when they come to inspect the places where we made our fields,
they would like to arrest us. But so far they haven't been able to ruin us.\textbackslash{}

24. P: Why is it that they say they don't want you to clear fields then?

25. T: They say that clearing fields makes the water dry up. When hillfolk clear
many swiddens, they say there is no water left for the \{towns/cities\}. That's
what they say [anyway]. But for us Lahu, if we can't clear fields to \{eat/survive\},
there's no way we can exist. And there is no [other] way for us to be able to earn
money either. Since we don't have [irrigated] paddy fields, we'd have to live in
misery if it came to that [chi qhe `like this'].

26. P: When you clear a swidden, how many years are you usually able to keep cultivating
a given swidden in the same place? After how many years do you have to begin clearing
a new one?

27. T-y: Well, for swiddens one piece of land is good for a single year. The second
year is not quite up to the \{first/new\footnote{ɔ̀-šɨ́, i.e., when the field was fresh}\} year.

28. T: That's right. That's the way it is with ``hanging onto old-fields.''\footnote{hɛ-g̈ɔ̂ g̈ɔ̂ʔ câ ve ``\{holding/hanging\} onto the field-bones'':}
Sometimes if we get a place where the soil is no good, even [if we cultivate it]
one year, even only one year, it's not good enough [to give us a decent crop],
and if we go to a second year, even if the plants \{are/look\} good,\footnote{dàʔ `be good; look good, be pretty'.} \{there
are no/they don't have\} seedpods.

29. P: \{So/That means that\} you have to begin to clear new ones. So what I've
heard is, when you clear land for swiddens you cut down and \{discard/abandon\}
lots of trees, they say. The \{lifespan/ age\} of a tree is about as long as a
human being's, they say. A given tree lives about fifty or sixty years! These trees
have a great value for Thailand, they say. The earning power of Thailand\footnote{Thây mû-mì phu g̈a ve kàʔ: ``Thailand's getting money.''} depends
only on those trees, they say. So they don't want to let you chop them down [they
say]. So then, for the Lahu people, if --- swiddens ---trees --- fields can't be
cleared, how will they be able to \{eat/survive/earn a living\}, this is \{it/the
problem\}. What have you been thinking about this? If they don't want to let you
clear land.

30. T: This is what they say. In order for us to \{get/manage\} to cultivate any
piece of land, they want to make us Lahu do it \{the way they say [chi qhe `this
way' (as follows)]\}. What they say is, they want us to plant various kinds of
fruit, tea, coffee --- and they say that we should make terraced fields. So for
this reason, for us Lahu, if that's what [we have to] do, there's no way for us
to go on.\footnote{phɛ̀ʔ la kɨ̀ lɛ̀ mâ cɔ̀: ``there's no way to become.''} However, in the future, how are we going to keep putting food in
our mouths\footnote{g̈a-câ-g̈a-dɔ̀: ``get-eat-get-drink''}, if the Thai authorities don't help us, for us it will cause a great
deal of suffering. Another things is, if we Lahu can't cultivate \{swiddens/mountainfields\},
we don't have paddy-fields \footnote{ti-mi: irrigated rice (paddy) field; only possible in the plains, or on the} either. And we don't have money (``silver and gold'')
either. If you have a few pigs and chickens, and sell them all off, you'd be able
to buy rice to eat. Besides all that, since we won't have any clothes to wear,
we'll be \{ashamed before other people/an object of shame for others\}.

31. P: When you've made a field/swidden, after a year or two, if the field is no
good, do you abandon it? When you've abandoned it like that, it becomes a \textit{h}ɛ\textit{-šā
}\footnote{We could translate this conventionally as ``oldfield.'' šā is a bound morpheme}, right? Once it's become an old field how many years does it take before
you can cultivate it again, that old field?

32. T: After cultivating a certain field, if we've only worked it for one year,
we can cultivate it again after about five years. But [\textit{l}ɛ] if [we] ``hold/hang
onto the field-bones,'' and cultivate it for another year, we should wait five
more years, so after about ten years we can cultivate it again.

33. P: What you call ``holding onto the field-bones,'' does it mean ``cultivating
twice [in the same place]''? I haven't understood very well. How do you ``hold
onto'' it?

34. T: Yes. What we call ``holding onto the field-bones'' means cultivating twice,
planting two years in the same field. That's the meaning of ``holding onto the
field-bones.'' So if you hold onto a single field for two years, you have to wait
about ten years. After you've waited for ten years, we can get a fair crop [out
of it]. But it's still not really good yet.

35. P: Now what the Thai government is saying, is that you can't clear fields for
cultivation in lots of new places, right? What they say is, that if you've got
to cultivate in just one place you [just] add (``put in'') fertilizer to the old
field once every year --- \{what do you think/what's your opinion\} of that? Can
you do it or not?

36. T: As for that, when we think it over, this business of adding fertilizer up
in the hills is extremely difficult. The thing is, since the ground isn't level,
when you add fertilizer, and it rains all of a sudden all the fertilizer is carried
off, so it's probably of no use to us, we think.

37. P: In that case, can't you make terraces?

38. T: ``Make terraces, terraces!'' they say, ``since the land is very steep, if
you just make them you'll succeed.'' But it takes a huge amount of time, so for
a very long time we would have to suffer and be miserable. Nevertheless, even though
making terraces is the best way, if the ground isn't flat, it's a very tough problem
for us Lahu. The thing is, there are no places to make terraces. Even if we did
finally manage to make terraces, how much --- how long it would have taken us,
we don't know.

39. P: If you were to make terraces on a mountain where you've cleared a field,
about how many years would it take? In order to make terraces \{properly/the right
way\}.

40. T: I guess that to go on [qɔ̀ʔ] to make terraces in a field that we've cleared
in the mountains, making field-terraces, in a single stretch of field, if it would
take two months to \{plow/cultivate/hoe\}, then unless [you work at it for] two
or three years, you couldn't finish making a terrace for that one field.

41. P: So then if you guys were just to make terraces, making them for one or two
years, how would you plan to eat? What would you look for to eat?

42. T: Right now that's what we Lahu are talking about. We can't figure it out.
We can't figure out what we'd be able to eat. The thing is, just cultivating our
swiddens, just planting rice, even without making terraces, some people don't get
enough to eat. Some years there's enough, other years it's not enough. So during
the time that we would have to make terraces, we wouldn't be able to raise pigs
and chickens. There wouldn't be enough time. So raising pigs and chickens, feeding
them until they get big, and then being able to sell them for money \footnote{g̈a qɔ̀ʔ hɔ̂ câ: a 4-verb concatenation. câ as a Vv means `do for} --- there'd
be nothing to feed them with. \footnote{Preserving the Lahu more literally: There would be nothing to feed them so}

43. P: Oh, well then, according to what you, Teacher \footnote{Paul addresses Pastor Cà-bo as šālā `teacher' (ult. \texttt{<} Skt.}, are saying, this making
of terraces and adding fertilizer to cultivate is probably impossible. But maybe
you actually could do it. \footnote{phɛ̀ʔ lɛ̀ phɛ̀ʔ ve yò: lit. ``as for being able, [you could] be able.''} If they [the government] really does help you, right?
They've got those bulldozers \footnote{mì-gɨ̀ gûʔ càʔ: ``machine for butting earth.'' gâʔ `collide; butt}, so if they themselves would come and do it for
you, move the earth for you, it could be done. But moving the earth just for one
or two of those villages, for such a small number of people, they probably couldn't
be bothered \footnote{te bɔ̀: `tired of doing; lazy to do'.}, I think. What do you guys think about this?

44. T: I think so too. As for their \footnote{``They'' here probably refers to the Thai officials of the \textit{nikhom}.} helping us, they can only help is a little
bit. The thing is, they don't even help us properly when we \{have them/get them
to\} bulldoze a place as a site for a house. For that reason, as far as their using
the government's machines to bulldoze for us, when the time to really do it comes,
they probably wouldn't do it just for one or two villages. What I think is, they
wouldn't do it even for a single village. But the thing is, they've got a lot of
money. And they also have several machines [=bulldozers]. However, it has never
yet entered their heads to properly help us hillfolk.

45. P: Well, it's just like I was saying before, isn't it, that if they're not
willing to let you clear land in the hills for a living, there are many stretches
of flat land in several provinces \footnote{mə̂ `country; district; province; town, city' \texttt{<} Tai (Si. myaŋ).}, so that when foreigners come to look things
over they say ``There are plenty of plains in this country of Thailand, there are
lots and lots of places to till and cultivate, so people don't \{die of hunger/starve\}.''
So then couldn't you manage to go ask for such a flat stretch, or a wooded plain
