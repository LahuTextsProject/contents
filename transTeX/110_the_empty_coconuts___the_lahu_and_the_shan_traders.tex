\textbf{110 The 'Empty Coconuts': the Lahu and the Shan Traders}

[Tape X, Side 1]

1 Once upon a time there was a certain man. 2 One day, leading a group of children,
he went along a road. 4 As they were going along the road, they arrived at a certain
place, where they saw a group of important-looking1 Shan \{traders / merchants\}.
4 Well, there were very many of these important traders. 5 When he saw them, he
said--he asked the Shans [a question]. 6 What he said was, ``\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}``
7 Which means ``Sirs, friends, what are you carrying [with you]?``

8 At this a Shan said, ``\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}.``

9 So then he asked again: ``\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}?``
10 That is, ``Sir, what are you carrying? 11 Then the Shan answered him
again, ``\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}.``
12 That is, the Shan was saying ``We're not carrying anything. 13 Our saddlebags
are all empty.``

14 Then \{the man / he\} said to the boys: ``Hey, boys, boys! They say
they're carrying coconuts2! 15 Wouldn't you like to eat some? 16 If you'd like
to eat some coconuts, why don't you all chip in some money3!`` 17 So the've
got some money together. 18 When he got the money they had collected, they said
to the Shans, ``Please sell us some coconuts.``

19 At this the Shan said, ``We have nothing to sell. 20 pao.....``
21 That is, ``Our saddlebags are empty4!``
