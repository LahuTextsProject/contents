\textbf{118 A Lahu Sells Wasp Larvae to a Shan }

[Tape X, Side 2]

1 Once there was a certain man. 2 One day he went into the jungle--one one of his
frequent forays into the jungle,1 he found a giant-wasp's nest. 3 Then when night
came he smoked the wasp's nest out.2 4 When he had smoked it out, he got a lot
of them.3 5 Then he took these wasp-larvae and went to sell them to a Shan.

6 Now this person didn't know any Shan at all. 7 The Shan said to him: \texttt{"}Amigo!
What are you carrying?\texttt{"}4 8 When he said this, [the Lahu] remained silent.
9 Then after a while the Shan said again, \texttt{"}Amigo! What are you carrying?\texttt{"}4

10 Finally he said \textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}.5
11 No matter how many times he asked, [he said] \texttt{"}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}6.\texttt{"}
