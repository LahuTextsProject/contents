\textbf{9 Agriculture and the Need for Unity}

[Tape 1,  Side 2 \#4 and Tape II, Side 1 \#1]

1: So, this time we'll have a discussion about how we Lahu \{grow our crops / practice
agriculture / farm our land\}. Well, whereabouts will all of you in the village
grow your crops this year?

2: Well, I['ll be] down below. Where I farmed last year. Probably I'll try elephant's-Death-Valley.\footnote{hwei-cà-tÁi (= No. Thai, lit. ``valley-elephants-die``).}

3: Mm, \textit{I['ll} be] over \textit{there} [gesture]. I'll work around Thai-lai.\footnote{A rocky area near the village, also called by the Thai phǎa-dɛɛŋ 'Red wall.' ô \emph{ɔ} 'over there'--i.e., 'off to the side,' as distinct from mô \emph{ɔ} 'down below.'}
I won't stay--er, I won't come down below. The elephants eat [the crops] up all
the time [down there].
