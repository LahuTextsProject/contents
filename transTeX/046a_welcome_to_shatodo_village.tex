46a Welcome Shatodo Village

\. This village is the Village of Shatodo.\footnote{A large Christian village in Thailand, about 120 km north of Chiang Mai, on}

\. In this Shatodu Village every single person \footnote{The notion of totality is emphatically conveyed by using three separate constructions:} is Christian.

\. And [we are] people who cultivate swiddens for a living.

\. In this village altogether there are---how many now?\footnote{qhà-ma nÁ (Puf): The particle nÁ expresses uncertainty. With this aside,}---er, two hundred and
seventy people.

\. So then all of us are folks who cultivate swiddens \footnote{Here the binome hɛ-ŋə̂ is used instead of the simple noun hɛ `swidden'.} for a living.
