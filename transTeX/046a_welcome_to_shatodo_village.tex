46a Welcome Shatodo Village

1. This village is the Village of Shatodo.\footnote{A large Christian village in Thailand, about 120 km north of Chiang Mai, on the River Kok on the Burmese border. The name šÁ-to-do \textasciitilde{} šÁ-to-dū is from Thai \textit{săntôndùù} (\textit{săn} `ridge' and \textit{tôndùu }Pterocarpus macrocarpus [a large beautiful timber tree]).}

2. In this Shatodu Village every single person \footnote{The notion of totality is emphatically conveyed by using three separate constructions: Nqh + tê phā `all the Nqh'; tê g̈â lê-le `every person'; dê-dê `all'. See DL: 631, 633, 709-10.} is Christian.

3. And [we are] people who cultivate swiddens for a living.

4. In this village altogether there are---how many now?\footnote{qhà-ma nÁ (Puf): The particle nÁ expresses uncertainty. With this aside, the speaker is seeking confirmation of the population figure from the others present.}---er, two hundred and
seventy people.

5. So then all of us are folks who cultivate swiddens \footnote{Here the binome hɛ-ŋə̂ is used instead of the simple noun hɛ `swidden'.} for a living.
