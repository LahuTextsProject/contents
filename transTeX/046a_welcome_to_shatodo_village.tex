\textbf{\#46a Welcome to the Village of Shatodo}

1. This village is the Village of Shatodo.\footnote{A big Christian village in Thailand, about 120 km north of Chiang Mai, on the River Kok on the Burmese border. The name \textbf{šÁ-to-dō}  is from Thai \textit{săntôndùu} (\textit{săn} `ridge' and \textit{tôndùu Pterocarpus macrocarpus}, a large beautiful timber tree.}

2. In this Shatodu Village every single person \footnote{The notion of totality is emphatically conveyed by using three separate constructions: Nqh + \textbf{tê phā} `all the Nqh';\textbf{ tê g̈â lê-le} `every person'; \textbf{dê-dê }`all'. See DL: 631, 633, 709-10.} is Christian.

3. And [we are] people who cultivate swiddens for a living.

4. In this village altogether there are---how many now? \footnote{\textbf{qhà-ma nÁ}: The particle \textbf{nÁ} expresses uncertainty. With this aside, the speaker is seeking confirmation of his population figure from the others present.}---er, two hundred and
seventy people.

5. So then all of us are folks who cultivate swiddens \footnote{Here the binome \textbf{hɛ-ŋə̂} is used instead of the simple noun \textbf{hɛ} `swidden'.} for a living.
