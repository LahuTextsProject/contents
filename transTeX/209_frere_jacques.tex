Frère Jacques

1 Older brother, older brother!

2 Enjoying your sleep? Enjoying your sleep?

3 You're a lazybones, you're a lazybones!

4 Hurry and get up, hurry and get up!

This traditional round was translated into Lahu by the author in 1966, and was
quickly learned by the villagers in Huey Tat, who sang it with great enjoyment.

The meaning of frère 'brother' in the original refers to a monastic brother, here
simply translated ``elder brother``.
