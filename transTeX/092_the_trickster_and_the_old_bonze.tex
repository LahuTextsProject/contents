1. Once upon a time, a certain old bonze\footnote{I.e., a Mahayana Buddhist monk. The word comes from French \textit{bonze} < Portuguese \textit{bonzo} < Jse. \textit{bonsō} < Chinese, ult. < Sanskrit.} took the Trickster [ɛ̀-qhɛ̀] along
with him to go carry salt.

2. The old bonze was riding a horse.

3. As for the Trickster, he made him go on foot.

4. Then after a while he made the Trickster carry the salt.

5. He [the bonze] arrived at a certain place on horseback, and stopped to rest.

6. At this point Trickster knocked loose\footnote{\textbf{dɔ̂ʔ-pū}: `sprinkle by striking' (``strike-pour'').} some cow-sage beans\footnote{\textbf{phɨ̂-(h)á-le} `cowsage; horse-eye bean' [\textit{Mucuna pruriens}] a creeper with fuzzy brown beans containing an itchy substance. See DL:921.} onto the horse's
saddle.

7. Then when the two of them continued on their way and reached a certain point,
[the bonze] said, ``Hey, Trickster, are you finding it easy to carry the salt?''

8. The Trickster said, ``Oh, it's very easy! It's not at all tiring. And how is
it going with you?'', he asked.

9. ``Oh, I can't ride this horse. My ass is itching like crazy. It's most unfitting!''
he said.

10. So then he said, ``Say, Trickster, let me carry your salt. You come ride the
horse.''

11. Then [the bonze] went further ahead.

12. Once he [the bonze] got further ahead, the Trickster knocked away what he had
sprinkled onto the horse, and went riding along.

13. Riding along he reached the outskirts of a strange village\footnote{\textbf{šu} \textbf{qhâʔ}: lit. ``other peoples' village''.}, and stayed
there [waiting for the bonze to catch up].

14. By the time the old bonze carrying the salt also reached the village, night
had fallen.

15. When it got dark he said to Trickster, ``How shall the two of us hide away
this salt?''\footnote{So it wouldn't be stolen during the night.}

16. Trickster said, ``Let's hide it down there inside that pond!''

17. Early the next morning, when the two of them went to look for the salt they
had hidden, they couldn't find it.

18. It had all become [dissolved in the] water.

19. He said to the Trickster, ``ɛ̀-qhɛ̀, what could have happened! I can't
find the salt!''

20. Trickster said, ``The fish have eaten it, the fish have eaten it! Let's hurry
and drain this pond.''

21. As they were draining it, some pa-ná-tɔ̄\footnote{An edible black fish with a white belly, about a foot long. Also called \textbf{pa-ná-qāy}. See DL:802.} came out, and Trickster slapped
them to death.

22. When some catfish\footnote{Spiny bottom feeders [\textit{Clarias batrachus}]. See DL:803.} emerged, [Trickster] made [the bonze] slap them [too].
\footnote{Thus lacerating his hand on the spines.}

23. So this old bonze suffered a world of pain.

24. Since he hurt so much, he said to Trickster, ``You're going to have to carry
me. If you don't carry me I can't make it.''

25. Thereupon Trickster said, ``Take it easy, take it easy! I'll go look for somebody
to carry you.''

26. So he wound his way upwards and dislodged a rock so it would roll downhill.

27. When [Trickster] said, ``Run! If it's not a tiger, it's a bear! Run!'', the
old bonze ran all the way back home.
