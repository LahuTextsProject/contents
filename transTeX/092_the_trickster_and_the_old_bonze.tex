92 The Trickster and the Old Bonze

1. Once upon a time, a certain old bonze\footnote{I.e., Buddhist monk. \texttt{<} French \texttt{<} Pg. bonzo \texttt{<} Jse.} took the Trickster [ɛ̀-qhɛ̀] along
with him to go carry salt.

2. He [the bonze] was riding a horse.

3. As for the Trickster [ɛ̀-qhɛ̀], [the bonze] made him go on foot.

4. After a while he made the Trickster carry the salt.

5. He [the bonze] arrived at a certain place on horseback, and stopped to rest.

6. At this point Trickster knocked loose \footnote{dôʔ-pū: `sprinkle by striking' (``strike-pour'')} some cow-sage beans \footnote{phɨ̂-(hÁ)-le `cowsage; horse-eye bean' [Mucuna pruriens] a creeper with} onto the horse's
saddle.

7. Then when the two of them continued on their way and reached a certain point,
[the bonze] said, ``Hey, Trickster, are you finding it easy \{pleasant\} to carry
the salt?''

8. The Trickster said, ``Oh, it's \{very easy/ a lot of fun\}. It's not at all
tiring. And how is it going with you?'' he asked.

9. ``Oh, I can't ride this horse. My \{arse/ ass\} is \{itching like mad/ so itchy\}.
It's most unfitting!'' he said.

10. Then he said, ``Say, Trickster, let me carry your salt. You come ride the horse.''

11. Then [the bonze] went further ahead.

12. Once he [the bonze] got further ahead, the Trickster knocked away what he had
knocked [i.e., the cowsage] onto [the saddle], and went riding along.

13. Having ridden along he reached the outskirts of a strange village \footnote{šu qhâʔ: lit. ``other peoples' village''.}, and
stayed there [waiting for the bonze to catch up].

14. By the time the old bonze carrying the salt also reached the village, night
had fallen.

15. When it got dark he said to Trickster, ``How shall we [dual] hide away this
salt?'' \footnote{So it won't be stolen during the night.}

16. Trickster said, ``Let's hide it down there inside that pond!''

17. Early the next morning, when the two of them went to look for the salt they
had hidden, they couldn't find it.

18. It had all \{become/ dissolved in the\} water.

19. He [the bonze] said to the Trickster, ``ɛ̀-qhɛ̀, I wonder what happened!
I can't find the salt!''

20. Trickster said, ``the fish have eaten it, the fish have eaten it. Let's hurry
and drain this \{pool/ pond\}.''

21. As they were draining it, some pa-nÁ-tɔ̄ \footnote{An edible black fish with a white belly, about a foot long. Also called pa-nÁ-qāy.} came out, and Trickster slapped
them to death.

22. When some catfish \footnote{Spiny bottom feeders} emerged, [Trickster] made [the bonze] slap them [too].
