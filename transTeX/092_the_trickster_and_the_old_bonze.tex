92 The Trickster and the Old Bonze

\. Once upon a time, a certain old bonze\footnote{I.e., Buddhist monk. \texttt{<} French \texttt{<} Pg. bonzo \texttt{<} Jse.} took the Trickster [ɛ̀-qhɛ̀] along
with him to go carry salt.

\. He [the bonze] was riding a horse.

\. As for the Trickster [ɛ̀-qhɛ̀], [the bonze] made him go on foot.

\. After a while he made the Trickster carry the salt.

\. He [the bonze] arrived at a certain place on horseback, and stopped to rest.

\. At this point Trickster knocked loose \footnote{dôʔ-pū: `sprinkle by striking' (``strike-pour'')} some cow-sage beans \footnote{phɨ̂-(hÁ)-le `cowsage; horse-eye bean' [Mucuna pruriens] a creeper with} onto the horse's
saddle.

\. Then when the two of them continued on their way and reached a certain point,
[the bonze] said, ``Hey, Trickster, are you finding it easy \{pleasant\} to carry
the salt?''

\. The Trickster said, ``Oh, it's \{very easy/ a lot of fun\}. It's not at all
tiring. And how is it going with you?'' he asked.

\. ``Oh, I can't ride this horse. My \{arse/ ass\} is \{itching like mad/ so itchy\}.
It's most unfitting!'' he said.

1\. Then he said, ``Say, Trickster, let me carry your salt. You come ride the horse.''

1\. Then [the bonze] went further ahead.

1\. Once he [the bonze] got further ahead, the Trickster knocked away what he had
knocked [i.e., the cowsage] onto [the saddle], and went riding along.

1\. Having ridden along he reached the outskirts of a strange village \footnote{šu qhâʔ: lit. ``other peoples' village''.}, and
stayed there [waiting for the bonze to catch up].

1\. By the time the old bonze carrying the salt also reached the village, night
had fallen.

1\. When it got dark he said to Trickster, ``How shall we [dual] hide away this
salt?'' \footnote{So it won't be stolen during the night.}

1\. Trickster said, ``Let's hide it down there inside that pond!''

1\. Early the next morning, when the two of them went to look for the salt they
had hidden, they couldn't find it.

1\. It had all \{become/ dissolved in the\} water.

1\. He [the bonze] said to the Trickster, ``ɛ̀-qhɛ̀, I wonder what happened!
I can't find the salt!''

2\. Trickster said, ``the fish have eaten it, the fish have eaten it. Let's hurry
and drain this \{pool/ pond\}.''

2\. As they were draining it, some pa-nÁ-tɔ̄ \footnote{An edible black fish with a white belly, about a foot long. Also called pa-nÁ-qāy.} came out, and Trickster slapped
them to death.

2\. When some catfish \footnote{Spiny bottom feeders} emerged, [Trickster] made [the bonze] slap them [too].
