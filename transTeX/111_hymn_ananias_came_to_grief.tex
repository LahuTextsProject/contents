Pastor: 1. At this point I would like to sing\footnote{Lit. ``do a hymn''. chî-mu-khɔ̂ (lift high word) `hymn', lit. ``words of} a hymn.

2. This hymn is [based on a passage] in The Acts of the Apostles, Chapter V, verses
1 to 5.\footnote{ganân ɨ `chapter' (``big number''); ganân i `verse' (``small number'')}

3. So now this hymn will be sung by two women, two mature women.\footnote{yâ-mî-ma `women'; chɔ-mɔ̂-ma `agèd woman'}

Singers: 4. It says in the Bible,

5. that having lied, they died, Ananias and Sapphira.\footnote{The relevant passages in the King James version are as follows:}

6. When they were making offerings to God, the apostle asked him, ``For your land
you only [got] this much?

7. Is that the truth, Ananias?''

8. ``Yes, I only got this much. Truly I only got this much.''

9. The apostle said, ``Do not lie to God, Ananias!''

10. Peter said, ``Do not lie to God, O Ananias!''

11. Suddenly Ananias \{fell down/keeled over\} and died.

12. Sapphira also had \{discussed it/talked it over\} with him in just this way.\footnote{I.e., she had colluded with her husband in preparing the lie.}

13. For this reason the couple both had to die.

14. For lying, one must truly die!

15. My brethren, for this reason let us cast aside all lies!

16. Lest we end up like Ananias!

17. The end.
