Pastor: \. At this point I would like to sing\footnote{Lit. ``do a hymn''. chî-mu-khɔ̂ (lift high word) `hymn', lit. ``words of} a hymn.

\. This hymn is [based on a passage] in The Acts of the Apostles, Chapter V, verses
1 to \.\footnote{ganân ɨ `chapter' (``big number''); ganân i `verse' (``small number'')}

\. So now this hymn will be sung by two women, two mature women.\footnote{yâ-mî-ma `women'; chɔ-mɔ̂-ma `agèd woman'}

Singers: \. It says in the Bible,

\. that having lied, they died, Ananias and Sapphira.\footnote{The relevant passages in the King James version are as follows:}

\. When they were making offerings to God, the apostle asked him, ``For your land
you only [got] this much?

\. Is that the truth, Ananias?''

\. ``Yes, I only got this much. Truly I only got this much.''

\. The apostle said, ``Do not lie to God, Ananias!''

1\. Peter said, ``Do not lie to God, O Ananias!''

1\. Suddenly Ananias \{fell down/keeled over\} and died.

1\. Sapphira also had \{discussed it/talked it over\} with him in just this way.\footnote{I.e., she had colluded with her husband in preparing the lie.}

1\. For this reason the couple both had to die.

1\. For lying, one must truly die!

1\. My brethren, for this reason let us cast aside all lies!

1\. Lest we end up like Ananias!

1\. The end.
