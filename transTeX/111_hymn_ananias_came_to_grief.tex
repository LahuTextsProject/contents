{\Large{}\textbf{\#111 Ananias Came to Grief (hymn)}}

{\Large{}\textit{<Pastor CÃ -bo> }}

{\Large{}1. At this point I would like us to sing [1] a hymn.}

{\Large{}2. This hymn is from The Acts of the Apostles, Chapter V, verses 1 to
5. [2]}

{\Large{}3. So now this hymn will be sung by two women, two mature women. [3]}

{\Large{}\textit{<Singers>}}

{\Large{}4. It says in the Bible,}

{\Large{}5. that having lied, they died, Ananias and Sapphira. [4]}

{\Large{}6. When they were making offerings to God, the apostle asked him, ``For
your land     }

{\Large{}you only got this much?}

{\Large{}7. Is that the truth, Ananias?''}

{\Large{}8. ``Yes, I only got this much. Truly I only got this much.''}

{\Large{}9. The apostle said, ``Do not lie to God, Ananias!''}

{\Large{}10. Peter said, ``Do not lie to God, O Ananias!''}

{\Large{}11. Suddenly Ananias keeled over and died.}

{\Large{}12. Sapphira also had talked it over with him in just this way.[5]}

{\Large{}13. For this reason the couple [6] both had to die.}

{\Large{}14. For lying, one must truly die!}

{\Large{}15. My brethren, for this reason let us cast aside all lies!}

{\Large{}16. Lest we end up like Ananias!}

{\Large{}17. The end.}
