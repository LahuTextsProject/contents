\textbf{\#169 Song: We must part}

1 Now we must separate for a while.

2 But do not be sad, my friend!

3 Missing you, when I get down to the town, the handkerchief you bought for me
to take \footnote{\textbf{vɨ̀ fə dàʔ tā} Vh-Vv-Vv-Pv ``buy-send-mutual-perfective''. Evidently they had each bought each other (\textbf{dàʔ}) a handkerchief as a keepsake.} will stay with me!

4 My friend, I'm going, indeed I'm going!

5 Let us get married!
