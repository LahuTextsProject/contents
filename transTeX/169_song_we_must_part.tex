169 Song: We must part

1 Now we must separate for a while.

2 But do not be sad, my friend!

3 Thinking of you, when I get down to the town, the handkerchief you bought for
me to take\footnote{vɨ̀ fə dàʔ tā Vh-V.v-V.v-Pv ``buy-send-mutual-perfective''. Evidently} will stay with me!

4 My friend, I'm going, indeed I'm going!
