\textbf{101 A Lahu Thanks a Shan Lady for Rice Without Curry }

[Tape X, Side 1]

1 Once there was a certain man.

2 He went to clear land for a road.[1]

3 Because they made him go clear land for a road.

4 He worked and worked on the road, and when the time came to go back home, he
was very hungry.

5 Since he was very hungry, he went to beg some food from a Shan.

6 So he said to the Shan: ``Madam. \{Would / Don't\} you have some cooked
rice?``[2]

7 The Shan said, ``I have, I have.

8 I don't have any curry to go with it, though.``[2]

9 So he said, ``Even if there's no curry, I'll eat it.``

10 Then the Shan [lady] ground up some peppers and gave them to him to eat.

11 When she had ground them up and given them to him, he ate and she felt him alone.3]12
As she was learning, the Shan said[4]: ``[Sorry] you didn't even get any
curry to eat.``

13 At this he [tried to] make [polite] conversation with the Shan:14 ``Though
I didn't get to\textit{eat} any curry, it was still delicious! Many thanks to you,
ma'am!`` he said.[5]
