48 Edifying Thoughts on God, Parents, and Village Welfare

\. Now what do we have to do so that all of our children in the future can \{expand/
develop\} our village's \{site/ location/ situation\}?

\. We have to carefully listen to what the government officials \footnote{mì-gɨ̀꞊jɔ̂-mɔ̂: lit. ``lords of the land''.} say.

\. \{Above all/ More importantly/ Especially\}, if you want to achieve a long life,
listen carefully to what your parents say. \footnote{See the fifth of the Ten Commandments.}

\. And even above that, if you want your spiritual life to improve, you must properly
follow in the footsteps of your God, the Lord Jesus Christ.

\. And also besides that, whether it's your older brother or your older sister,
they are like your parents with respect to the material side \footnote{ɔ̀-šɨ̄-ɔ̀-šā꞊phɔ̂: lit. ``the aspect of one's blood and flesh''.} of your life on
earth.

\. One's parents, if we consider the earthly, material point of view, are like
everybody's God.

\. Everything \{under/ above\} the heavens is truly [the work of] God, the creator
of heaven and earth.

\. Therefore all of you boys and girls should take careful heed of the excellent
words of Lord Jesus.

\. \{Finally/ Besides this\}, may peace be upon all of your households!
