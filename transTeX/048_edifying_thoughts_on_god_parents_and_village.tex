48 Edifying Thoughts on God, Parents, and Village Welfare

1. Now what do we have to do so that all of our children in the future can \{expand/
develop\} our village's \{site/ location/ situation\}?

2. We have to carefully listen to what the government officials \footnote{mì-gɨ̀꞊jɔ̂-mɔ̂: lit. ``lords of the land''.} say.

3. \{Above all/ More importantly/ Especially\}, if you want to achieve a long life,
listen carefully to what your parents say. \footnote{See the fifth of the Ten Commandments.}

4. And even above that, if you want your spiritual life to improve, you must properly
follow in the footsteps of your God, the Lord Jesus Christ.

5. And also besides that, whether it's your older brother or your older sister,
they are like your parents with respect to the material side \footnote{ɔ̀-šɨ̄-ɔ̀-šā꞊phɔ̂: lit. ``the aspect of one's blood and flesh''.} of your life on
earth.

6. One's parents, if we consider the earthly, material point of view, are like
everybody's God.

7. Everything \{under/ above\} the heavens is truly [the work of] God, the creator
of heaven and earth.

8. Therefore all of you boys and girls should take careful heed of the excellent
words of Lord Jesus.

9. \{Finally/ Besides this\}, may peace be upon all of your households!
