1. Now what do we have to do so that all of our children in the future can be assured
of

the stability of our village's site?

2. We have to listen carefully to what the government officials\footnote{\textbf{mì-gɨ̀} \textbf{jɔ̂-mɔ̂}: lit. ``lords of the land''.} say.

3. More importantly, if you want to achieve a long life, listen carefully to what
your parents

say.\footnote{See the fifth of the Ten Commandments: ``Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.'' \textit{Exodus} 20:12.}

4. And even above that, if you want your spiritual life to improve, you must properly
follow

in the footsteps of your God, the Lord Jesus Christ.

5. And also besides that, whether it's your older brother or your older sister,
they are like

your parents with respect to the material side\footnote{\textbf{ɔ̀-šɨ̄-ɔ̀-šā-phɔ̂}: lit. ``the aspect of one's blood and flesh''.} of your life on earth.

6. One's parents, if we consider the earthly, material point of view, are like
everybody's God.

7. Everything throughout the heavens\footnote{\textbf{mû-nɔ-ma} \textbf{qhôʔ} \textbf{ve} \textbf{qha-pə̀-e}: lit. ``everything above the heavens''.} is truly [the work of] God, the creator
of heaven

and earth.

8. Therefore all of you boys and girls should take careful heed of the excellent
words of

Lord Jesus.

9. Finally, may peace be upon all of your households!
