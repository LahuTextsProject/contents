1. Somebody: ao⁴⁴ meɛ⁵⁵ yauʔ⁵⁵ nɛʔ²² maɨ⁵⁵\footnote{This sentence was uttered in Shan with a Lahu accent by someone fooling around. It is roughly transcribed as in my field notebook (1966).}

take wife already or not

Are you married yet?

2. T (Cà-bo): Well, we can get started now, we can do it now.

3. Yâ-pā-ɛ́\footnote{\textbf{Yâ-pā-ɛ́} (``Sonny'') was an unmarried teenager when this was recorded. He was the chief consultant during my 1977 fieldtrip.}: \direct{Selections on the jewsharp}

4. T: Ah, that sounds really great! Hmm --- maybe it wasn't recorded.\footnote{\textbf{khɔ̂} `voice, sound, noise, words' is used in two senses in \#4: \textbf{ɔ̀-khɔ̂} \textbf{dàʔ} \textbf{jâ} `the sound is very good', then \textbf{â} \textbf{cɔ̀} \textbf{ve} \textbf{khɔ̂} `probably not there' (i.e., probably not recorded), where \textbf{khɔ̂} means `the probable reason why'. See DL pp. 380-383.}

5. P (Cà-lɔ̂): [IN ENGLISH] You have rubbed out ---

6. Thû-yì\footnote{\textbf{Thû-yì}, another young man who was a good friend in 1965-6, died soon after, reputedly because of black magic. See DL: 681.}: \direct{Jewsharp selection}

7. T: Wow, that sounds great!

8. H: Well, the way we Lahu use the jewsharp\footnote{Now often euphemistically called ``jawharp'' in English. For details on this Lahu musical instrument see DL: 85 and Plate 2.}, it's for the young men and marriageable
girls\footnote{\textbf{chɔ-há} `young man, bachelor'; \textbf{yâ-mî-há} `marriageable young woman'} to use!

9. This blowing of the jewsharp is a language for courting the girls!

10. When we call this Lahu custom of ours \textit{nā-kû-qá nā-kû-qō-lò}ʔ
that's just [imitating] the sound.\footnote{These seven syllables are meant to imitate the twanging of the jewsharp, as the Headman says. But some people etymologize the syllables \textbf{nā-kû} as \textbf{na} \textbf{kù} (\textbf{na} Bn `morpheme in female names'), \textbf{kù} (V) `call', i.e. ``girl-calling''.}

11. If you just say \textit{nā-kû-qá} it means telling the girls `Come!'

12. The meaning is, ``Oh, Lahu maid,\footnote{\textbf{Lâhū-ma} \textbf{òʔ}: a formulaic term of address in courtship.} whether I'm worthy or not,\footnote{\textbf{qhâ} \textbf{mâ} \textbf{qhâ} \textbf{thɔ̂}: ``worthy-not-worthy-even''. \textbf{qhâ} (Vadj) `have good qualities'.} do come!
Let's try to have a conversation!''

13. Otherwise, unless we go around blowing the jewsharp, unless we go and do that,
no matter what our guys say, they won't listen.

14. All around the village, at night\footnote{\textbf{tâ-khɨ̂} `at night' < Shan (cf. Si. \textit{tháŋ khyyn}) is sometimes used instead of native Lahu \textbf{mû phə̀ʔ thâ} (lit. ``when the heavens are revealed''). See DL: 998.} when you can't see anything, even if we
just go walking around,\footnote{I.e., without going into any girl's house.} when the sound of the jewsharp is heard twanging in
the distance, all the girls say, ``Oh, the guys are coming!'', and they want to
come [out of their houses.]

15. When a girl comes, they can have a conversation

with each other.

16. This custom, this blowing the jewsharp, if an older person should hear it,
would be embarrassing.

17. But one doesn't blow it inside the house.

18. At night, when it's dark, when you're outside the house sitting on the ground
chatting with the girl, that's when you blow for her.

19. A girl --- when a girl hears it, she knows ``Ah, I hear\footnote{The intensifying particle \textbf{qha-pâʔ} is used in situations where hearing or not hearing is the issue. (See DL: 272).} the guys coming!'',
that's what she'll think in her heart.

20. If she wants to flirt with the guy, even if she had been doing some work she'll
put it aside, and say ``I'll just go outside for a while, I'll just take a poop.''

21. So, since she wants to flirt with the guy, well, she just goes off to flirt
with him.

22. In the deep woods, at night even though people are sleeping, they're not sleeping
yet.

23. So when they hear the sound of a guy blowing the jewsharp, it's very melancholy,
and they converse with each other to their heart's content.\footnote{\textbf{ni-qhâ} \textbf{šɨ} \textbf{ve}: lit. ``heart's path is stable''.}

24. There are even some people who marry each other because of good jewsharp blowing.

25. Among us Lahu young men and women, the sound of some of them blowing the jewsharp
is very pretty, they can blow pretty well.

26. \direct{But} some others, seeing other people doing it, just fool
around when they do it.

27. They don't know the meanings or the sounds.

28. Among us Lahu, there are even some people, some girls, who even if the guy
is quite ugly, if he can do various things like play the sideways flute,\footnote{\textbf{lɛ́-tû(-qâ}): single-tubed wind instrument, held sideways like a Western transverse flute.} sing,
blow the gourd-flute,\footnote{\textbf{nɔ̄}: musical instrument with a gourd as resonating chamber, to which five bamboo tubes are attached with beeswax. See DL: 794 and PLATE \#42.} make songs, blow the jewsharp, then that's just who they
want to marry.

29. Some the girls, even if the guy has nothing, even if he's ugly, if he has just
one thing, a possession that she would like to have, a thing that the girl wants,
then she'll marry him.

30. There are also people who get married even if they don't want to have the guy's
body, but just want the things he has.

31. We Lahu have customs like this.
