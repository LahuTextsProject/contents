77a Wooing the Maidens (Part II)

\. Somebody:  ao⁴⁴ meɛ⁵⁵ yauʔ⁵⁵ nɛʔ\ensuremath{^2}\ensuremath{^1}  maɨ⁵⁵\footnote{This sentence was uttered in Shan with a Lahu accent by someone fooling around.}

take wife already PRT/or? you?

Are you married yet?

\. T (Cà-bo): Well, we can get started now, we can do it now.

\. Yâ-pā-ɛ́\footnote{Yâ-pā-ɛ́ (``Sonny'') was an unmarried teenager when this was recorded.}: \texttt{<}Selections on the jewsharp\texttt{>}

\. T: Ah, that sounds really great! Hmm --- maybe it wasn't recorded\footnote{\textit{kh}ɔ̂ `voice, sound, noise, words' is used in two senses in \#4:}.

\. P (Cà-lɔ̂): [IN ENGLISH] You have rubbed out ---

\. Thû-yì\footnote{Thû-yì, another young man who was a good friend in 1965-6, died soon after,}: \texttt{<}Jewsharp selection\texttt{>}

\. T: Wow, that sounds great!

\. H: Well, the way we Lahu use the jewsharp \footnote{Now often euphemistically called ``jawharp'' in English. For details on this}, it's for the young men and marriageable
girls \footnote{chɔ-hÁ `young man, bachelor'; yâ-mî-hÁ `marriageable young woman'} to use!

\. This blowing of the jewsharp is a language for courting the girls!

1\. When we call this Lahu custom of ours \textit{nā-kû-qÁ nā-kû-qō-lò}ʔ
that's just \{the sound/onomatopoeia\}.\footnote{These seven syllables are meant to imitate the twanging of the jewsharp, as}

1\. If you just say \textit{nā-kû-qÁ} it means telling the girls `Come!'

1\. The meaning is, ``Oh, Lahu maid,\footnote{Lâhū-ma òʔ: a formulaic term of address in courtship.} whether I'm worthy or not,\footnote{qhâ mâ qhâ thɔ̂: ``worthy-not-worthy-even''. qhâ (Vadj) `have good qualities'.} do come!
Let's try to have a conversation!''

1\. Otherwise, unless we go around blowing the jewsharp, unless we go and do that,
no matter what our guys say, they \texttt{<}the girls\texttt{>} won't listen.

1\. All around the village, at night\footnote{tâ-khɨ̂ `at night' \texttt{<} Shan (cf. Si. thÁŋ khyyn) is sometimes} when you can't see anything, even if we
just go walking around,\footnote{I.e., without going into any girl's house.} when the sound of the jewsharp is heard \{twanging/buzzing\}
in the distance,\footnote{The intensifying particle qha-pâʔ is used in situations where hearing or} all the girls say, ``Oh, the guys \{are coming/are here/have
come\}!'', and they want to come \texttt{<}out of their houses.\texttt{>}

1\. When a girl comes, they can \{talk/hold a conversation\} with each other.

1\. This custom, this blowing the jewsharp, if an older person should hear it,
would be embarrassing.

1\. But one doesn't blow it in \{the/a\} house.

1\. At night, when it's dark, when you're outside the house sitting on the ground
chatting with the girl, that's when you blow for her.

1\. A girl --- when a girl hears it, she knows ``Ah, I hear\footnote{ni-qhâ šɨ ve: lit. ``heart's path is stable''.} the guys coming!'',
\texttt{<}that's what\texttt{>} she'll think in her heart.

2\. If she wants to flirt with the guy, even if she had been doing some work she'll
put it aside, and say ``I'll just go outside for a while, I'll just take a poop.''

2\. So, since she wants to flirt with the guy, well, she just goes off to flirt
with him.

2\. In the deep woods, at night even though people are sleeping, they're not sleeping
yet.

2\. So when they hear the sound of a guy blowing the jewsharp, it's very melancholy,
and they converse with each other to \{his/her/their\} heart's content.\footnote{ni-qhâ šɨ ve: lit. ``heart's path is stable''.}

2\. There are even some people who marry each other because of this jewsharp blowing.\footnote{Á-thâ mêʔ dàʔ lɛ: The reciprocal Pv dàʔ here indicates that the jewsharp}

2\. Among us Lahu young men and women, the sound of some of them blowing the jewsharp
is very pretty, they can blow pretty well.

2\. \texttt{<}But\texttt{>} some others, seeing other people doing it, just fool
around when they do it.

2\. They don't know the meanings or the sounds.

2\. Among us Lahu, there are even some people, some girls, who even if the guy
is quite ugly, if he can do various things like play the sideways flute,\footnote{lɛ́-tû(-qâ): single-tubed wind instrument, held sideways like a Western} sing,
blow the gourd-flute,\footnote{nɔ̄: musical instrument with a gourd as resonating chamber, to which five} make songs, blow the jewsharp, then that's just who they
want to marry.

2\. Some of them \texttt{<}girls\texttt{>}, even if the guy has nothing, even if
he's ugly, if he has just one thing, a possession that she would like to have,
a thing that the girl wants, then she'll marry him.

3\. There are also people who get married even if they don't want to have the \texttt{<}guy's\texttt{>}
body, but just want the thing \texttt{<}he has\texttt{>}.

3\. We Lahu have customs like this.
