77a Wooing the Maidens (Part II)

1. Somebody: Are you married yet?\footnote{This sentence was uttered in Shan with a Lahu accent by someone fooling around.}

2. T (Cà-bo): Well, we can get started now, we can do it now.

3. Yâ-pā-ɛ́:\footnote{Yâ-pā-ɛ́ (``Sonny'') was an unmarried teenager when this was recorded.} \texttt{<}Selections on the jew's-harp\texttt{>}

4. T: Ah, that sounds really great! Hmm -- maybe it wasn't recorded.\footnote{\textit{(ɔ̀-)khɔ̂} `voice, sound, noise, words' is used in two senses in this sentence: \textit{ɔ̀-khɔ̂ dàʔ jâ} `the sound is very good’, then \textit{â cɔ̀ ve khɔ̂} `probably not there’ (i.e., probably not recorded), where \textit{khɔ̂} means `the probable reason why.’ See DL:380-383.}

5. P (Cà-lɔ̂): [IN ENGLISH] You have rubbed out ---

6. Thû-yì:\footnote{Thû-yì, another young man who was a good friend in 1965-6, died soon after, reputedly because of black magic. See DL:681.} \texttt{<}jew's-harp selection\texttt{>}

7. T: Wow, that sounds great!

8. H: Well, the way we Lahu use the jew's-harp,\footnote{Now sometimes euphemistically called ``jawharp'' in English. For details on this Lahu musical instrument see DL:85 and Plate 2.} it's for the young men and marriageable girls to use!

9. This blowing of the jew's-harp is a language for courting the girls!

10. When we call this Lahu custom of ours \textit{nā-kû-qá-nā-kû-qō-lôʔ}ʔ
that's just \{the sound/onomatopoeia\}.\footnote{These seven syllables are meant to imitate the twanging of the jew's-harp, as the Headman says. But some people etymologize the syllables \textit{nā-kû} as \textit{na kù} (na ‘morpheme in female names’, kù ‘call’, i.e. “girl-calling”).}

11. If you just say \textit{nā-kû-qá} it means telling the girls `Come!'

12. The meaning is, ``Oh, Lahu maid,\footnote{Lâhū-ma òʔ: a formulaic term of address in courtship.} whether I'm worthy or not,\footnote{qhâ mâ qhâ thɔ̂: ``worthy-not-worthy-even''. qhâ `have good qualities'.} do come!
Let's try to have a conversation!''

13. Otherwise, unless we go around blowing the jew's-harp, unless we go and do that,
no matter what our guys say, they won't listen.

14. All around the village, at night\footnote{tâ-khɨ̂ `at night' \texttt{<} Shan (cf. Si. tháŋ khyyn) is sometimes used instead of native Lahu mû phə̀ʔ thâ (lit. “when the heavens are revealed”). See DL: 998.} when you can't see anything, even if we just go walking around,\footnote{I.e., without going into any girl's house.} when the sound of the jew's-harp is heard twanging in the distance, all the girls say, ``Oh, the guys are here!’’, and they want to come [out of their houses.]

15. When a girl comes, they can hold a conversation with each other.

16. This custom, this blowing the jew's-harp, if an older person should hear it, it would be embarrassing.

17. But one doesn't blow it in the house.

18. At night, when it's dark, when you're outside the house sitting on the ground
chatting with the girl, that's when you blow for her.

19. A girl -- when a girl hears it, she knows ``Ah, I hear\footnote{The intensifying particle qha-pâʔ is used in situations where hearing or not hearing is the issue. See DL:272.} the guys coming!'' [That's what] she'll think in her heart.

20. If she wants to flirt with the guy, even if she had been doing some work she'll put it aside, and say ``I'll just go outside for a while, I'll just take a poop.''

21. So, since she wants to flirt with the guy, well, she just goes off to flirt with him.

22. In the deep woods, at night even though people are sleeping, \textit{they're} not sleeping yet.

23. So when they hear the sound of a guy blowing the jew's-harp, it's very plaintive, and they converse with each other to their heart's content.\footnote{ni-qhâ šɨ ve: lit. ``heart's path is stable''.}

24. There are even some people who marry each other just because of this jew's-harp blowing.

25. Among us Lahu young men and women, the sound of some of them blowing the jew's-harp is very pretty, they can blow quite well.

26. But some others, seeing other people doing it, just fool around when they do it.

27. They don't know the meanings or the sounds.

28. Among us Lahu, there are even some people, some girls, who even if the guy is quite ugly, if he can do various things like play the sideways flute,\footnote{lɛ́-tû(-qâ): a single-tubed wind instrument, held sideways like a Western transverse flute.} sing, blow the gourd-flute,\footnote{nɔ̄: a musical instrument with a gourd as resonating chamber, to which five bamboo tubes are attached with beeswax. See DL:794 and plate 42.} make songs, blow the jew's-harp, then that's just who they want to marry.

29. Some of them, even if the guy has nothing, even if he's ugly, if he has just one thing, a possession that she would like to have, a thing that the girl wants, then she'll marry him.

30. There are also people who get married even if they don't want to have the [guy’s] body, but just want the thing [he has].

31. We Lahu have customs like this.
