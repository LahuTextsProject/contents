141 The Flea and the Louse

[told in some kind of Yellow Lahu]

1 The story of the Friendship of the Flea and the Louse.

2 Once when the flea and the louse were friends, the dog got angry --- I mean the
flea got angry and jumped onto the louse's belly.

3 So then the louse got angry and jumped onto the flea's buttocks.

4 To this very day, the flea's buttocks are flat and round.

5 And the louse's belly is still huge.
