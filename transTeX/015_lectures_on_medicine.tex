1 Well, these are things the great medical Doctor1 [was saying]. 2 And what the
great doctor tells us we have to \{learn / study\} every day, down there. 3 Well,
what the great doctor said was, that when we Lahu are sick and ailing2 we only
come [for treatment] when it's too late. 4 And the government is very concerned,
he says, whenever such a person is lost. 5 So, brothers, he told me to let you
hear and let you know [what you should do]:

6 Well then, no matter what ails a person, whether he has a headache, or no matter
how [else] he may be feeling unwell or sick,3 let him get to [the doctor's] quickly
and in good time. 7 Come in good time, he says! 8 Down there the government4 has
set up a hospital. 9 So now nobody has to pay any money [for medical treatment].
10 Don't be sick and suffer all by yourselves, he says. 11 ``Brothers,
if you arrive down there after suffering and suffering for a long time, when you're
practically dead, even if they try to restore your strength you can only survive
for a little while, he says. 12 Your strength--you have no strength. 13 You're
just too weak. 14 When that time comes, even if he [tries to] give you back your
strength, your strength is no longer enough. 15 So when somebody is getting to
feel slightly unwell, whoever it is who's sick, a group [of us] should talk it
over a little, and we should all cheerfully take him and put him into [the hospital]
in good time--even if he can't walk.5

16 Also, when it happens that a woman is to give birth to a child, your know when
the time for the birth has arrived, when the month has arrived. 17 If you [women]
all stay up [here] in the mountains [for your deliveries], if you can manage to
give birth all by yourselves, you do. 18 But if you can't give birth you just die,
he says. 19 He says he has seen several \{people / cases\} like that. 20 They--er,
for this reason, from this year on, when the time comes for a woman to give birth,
let her come while there is time to the hospital down in the valley, he says.

21 Then when she gives birth--er, when she has finished giving birth--um--and uh--he
says you're not supposed to sleep with the mother.

22 For four days you shouldn't put [the baby] with the mother. 23 He says that
they observe this custom. 24 For four days it shouldn't stay with the mother. 25
That way the mother \{regains / has\} her full strength and energy.6 26 She doesn't
lose her strength and energy. 27 Then she will always be full of strength and vigor,
and her physical condition7 and strength will not deteriorate. 28 That way her
strength remains great, he says. 29 When she arrives down there and has had her
baby, they take care of the child separately8 at the same time [she is regaining
her strength]. 30 For four days they feed it cow's milk. 31 They take care of it.
32 So this woman, the mother, once she has already borne the child, then she can
[just] \{rest / sleep\}. 33 After she rests for this time, er, when all four days
have passed, if she says she wants to see her baby, she may have it put down with
her. 34 But, it's fine to have them take care of it for you9 right up until the
time you're led back home. 35 Seeing that you don't have to spend a red cent [for
it], he says you might as well10 let them take care of it.

36 But, about the matter of being allowed to go home, down there they have this
rule for everybody who enters [the hospital]: 37 They don't send you home for six
or seven days--or neither in less than seven days. 38 That's a rule that they follow,
he says. 39 After six or seven days you can be sent back.

40 So, everybody, there is no need to suffer! 41 Let everybody--er, instead of
continuing to die in the same old way, come [to the hospital] early and in good
time, and be cured, he says. 42 Down there the government has arranged it for you.

43 The other day, from over there on the mountain they call Doi Suthep,11 there
was a Meo [ woman] I think he said it was12 who came to give birth to a child,
because there on the mountain she couldn't give birth.13 44 She had been in labor14
for four days, he said. 45 She was in labor, [but] the child was blocked.15 46
But she didn't come [to the hospital] quickly. 47 Since four days had passed the
mother was already very weak, he said.16 48 When she arrived down there she could
no longer speak. 49 She had very little strength left. 50 Then they tried giving
her stimulants,17 but even though they did, it was of no use.18 51 She had very
little strength, it was almost all gone, so when she arrived down there there was
nothing to be done but to take out the child [by Caesarean section]. 52 The mother
had very little strength left. 53 She had very little strength left. 54 Well, when
they took out the child, the mother died on the spot, he said. 55 Because it was
too late. 56 Don't let this happen to you,19 he says! 57 ``Let all your
brothers hear this!`` he told me.

[Sentences 58 to 61 are garbled and add nothing.]

58 And that person's dying down there.... 59 This greet doctor is on all the, uh--over20
Chiengmai--an adviser in the government bureau--uh, he's a member of this big committee.
60 So that's [how it is with] that doctor, down there. 61 So, as he said, everybody
please go down there to be treated....
