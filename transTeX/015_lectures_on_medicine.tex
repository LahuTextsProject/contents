{\Large{}1. Well, these are the things the great medical doctor [1] [was saying].
}

{\Large{}2. And what the great doctor tells us we have to learn every day, down
there. }

{\Large{}3. Well, what the great doctor said was, that when we Lahu are sick and
ailing [2] we only come [for treatment] when it's too late. }

{\Large{}4. And the government is very concerned, he says, whenever such a person
is lost. }

{\Large{}5. So, brothers and sisters, he told me to let you hear and let you know
[what you should do].}

{\Large{}6. Well then, no matter what ails a person, whether he has a headache,
or no matter how he may be feeling unwell or sick [3], he ought to get to [the
doctor's] quickly and in good time. }

{\Large{}7. Come in good time, he says! }

{\Large{}8. Down there the government [4] has set up a hospital. }

{\Large{}9. So now nobody has to pay any money [for medical treatment]. [5]}

{\Large{}10. Don't keep on suffering all by yourselves, he says. }

{\Large{}11. Brothers, if you arrive down there after suffering and suffering for
a long time, when you're practically dead, even if they try to restore your strength
you can only survive for a little while, he says. }

{\Large{}12. You have no strength. }

{\Large{}13. You're just too weak. }

{\Large{}14. When that time comes, even if he [tries to] give you back your strength,
your strength is no longer enough. }

{\Large{}15. So when somebody is getting to feel slightly unwell, whoever it is
who's sick, a group [of us] should talk it over a little, and we should all cheerfully
take him and put him into [the hospital] in good time--even if he can't walk. [6]
}

{\Large{}16. Also, when it happens that a woman is to give birth to a child, your
know when the time for the birth has arrived, when the month has arrived. }

{\Large{}17. If you [women] all stay up here in the mountains [for your deliveries],
if you can manage to give birth all by yourselves, you do. }

{\Large{}18. But if you can't give birth you just die, he says. }

{\Large{}19. He says they have seen several cases like that. }

{\Large{}20. For this reason, from this year on, when the time comes for a woman
to give birth, if you watch her and realize that she has a hard time giving birth,
let her come down while there is still time to the hospital in the valley, he says.
}

{\Large{}21. Then when she gives birth, when she has finished giving birth -- er
-- he says you're not supposed to sleep with the mother. [7]}

{\Large{}22. For four days you shouldn't put the baby with the mother. }

{\Large{}23. He says that they observe this rule. }

{\Large{}24. For four days it shouldn't stay with the mother. }

{\Large{}25. That way the mother regains her full strength and energy. [8]}

{\Large{}26. She doesn't lose her strength and energy. }

{\Large{}27. Then she will always be full of strength and vigor, and her physical
condition [9] and strength will not deteriorate. }

{\Large{}28. That way her strength remains great, he says. }

{\Large{}29. When she arrives down there and has had her baby, they take care of
the child separately [10] at the same time [she is regaining her strength]. }

{\Large{}30. For four days they feed it cow's milk. }

{\Large{}31. They take care of it. }

{\Large{}32. So this woman, the mother, once she has already borne the child, then
she can sleep in the same room      }

{\Large{}with it.}

{\Large{}33. After they've been in the same room -- er -- when all four days have
passed, if she says she wants to see her baby, she may have it put down with her.
}

{\Large{}34. But, it's fine to have them take care of it for you [11] right up
until the time you're led back home. }

{\Large{}35. Seeing that you don't have to spend a red cent [for it], he says you
might as well [12] let them take care of it. }

{\Large{}36. But, about the matter of being allowed to go home, down there they
have this rule for everybody who enters [the hospital], the doctor says.}

{\Large{}37. They don't let you be sent home for six or seven days.. }

{\Large{}38. That's a rule that they follow, he says. }

{\Large{}39. After six or seven days you can be sent back. }

{\Large{}40. So, everybody, there is no need to suffer! }

{\Large{}41. Instead of continuing to die for nothing in the same old way, [13]
come [to the hospital] early and in good time, and be cured, he says. }

{\Large{}42. Down there the government has arranged it for you.}

{\Large{}43. The other day, from over there on the mountain they call Doi Suthep
