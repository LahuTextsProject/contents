134 I long for thee, Jerusalem

[Choral song, sung antiphonally]

---Oh Jerusalem, how I long for thee!

---Long for thee!

---Oh Jerusalem, my heart is sore for thee!

---Sore for thee!

---Oh Jerusalem, how I long for thee!

---Long for thee!

Oh when shall I get to live with thee?

---Oh, Jerusalem, we thee---

---Jerusalem

Heaven  Up in heaven

That holy  The holy one

Good people  Good people pure people

Pure people  All their dwellings

All their dwellings Are prepared for them

Country  God's country

The holiest of all holies there That holy place

To you    INAUDIBLE

We shall enter in  INAUDIBLE

Hearts    Good hearts

Pure    Those who have[2]

All those people  Shall enter in

Oh pure and holy city of God! (2)

Jerusalem, my holy Temple, my holy dwelling on high,

With you ... happy and content I shall live [apparently there are a few inaudible
words here]

Jerusalem, that holy place.
