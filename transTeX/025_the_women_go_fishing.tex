\textbf{\#25 The Women Go Fishing}

<All female speakers. Recorded at Huey Tat, March 9, 1965>

1. A: Which section [of the stream] shall we dam up?

2. B: We'll just go dam \footnote{\textbf{tɔ̄ câ}: lit. ``dam-eat.'' As a post-head versatile verb \textbf{câ }`eat' means `to V for a living'.} it at Mɛ-thà-lây \footnote{\textbf{Mɛ-thà-lây} is a small Thai village on a stream flowing at the foot of a mountain near Huey Tat.}!

3. C: I'll go too!

4. D: [I'll] go, [I'll] go.

5. A: Carry along a mattock \footnote{\textbf{thɔ̄-qwɛ̀ʔ} (also \textbf{kɔ̂-ŋwɛ̂ʔ}): a digging tool resembling a trowel, with a curved handle. See plate \#18 in DL.}! And take along a hoe too!

6. B: Of course we'll carry them.

7. A: And carry a  plastic sheet too!

8. B: We've got to carry [one]. If we didn't, since the water's especially high,
we probably wouldn't be able to dam it.

9. C: Well then, one way to do it would probably be to dam one or two sections
of this fork in the stream .\footnote{\textbf{lɔ-qa}: a fork in a stream such that the two branches rejoin later.}

10. A: That's what we'll have to do. The two of you, mother and child \footnote{One of the women (``B'') has brought her small child along.}, go dam
it properly \footnote{\textbf{qha-dɛ̀ʔ} (Adv.): A culturally important adverb, `properly; right; thoroughly; the way one should'.} upstream .\footnote{The fuller form of this word is \textbf{g̈ɨ̀-ú} (lit. ``water-head``).} I'll do it downstream.

11. B: I'll do it right, You wait for me the way you should.

12. C: They're probably over on that side, the fish.

13. D: Wherever you're planning to stay [and wait], that's just where you have
to dam it.

14. B: Why don't you dam it on that side. Dam it on that side! That's where they
probably are, the fish.

15. A: I'll dig some earth and pile it up for you.  You two, mother and child,
go pick up stones to stack.

16. C: All right, I'll carry them and plaster \footnote{The idea is to plaster mud onto the piles of stones to impede the flow of water.} them over with all my might.
