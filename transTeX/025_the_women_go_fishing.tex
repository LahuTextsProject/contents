\texttt{<}All female speakers. Recorded at Huey Tat, March 9, 1965\texttt{>}

\. A: Which section [of the stream] shall we dam up?

\. B: We'll go dam \footnote{tɔ̄ câ: lit. ``dam-eat.'' As a post-head versatile verb, câ `eat' means} it at Mɛ-thà-lây \footnote{Mɛ-thà-lây is a small Thai village on a stream flowing at the foot of a}!

\. C: I'll go too!

\. D: [I'll] go, [I'll] go.

\. A: Carry along a mattock \footnote{thɔ̄-qwɛ̀ʔ (syn. kɔ̂-ŋwɛ̂ʔ): a digging tool resembling a trowel,}! And take along a hoe too!

\. B: Of course we'll carry them.

\. A: And carry a \{rubber/ plastic\} shut too!

\. B: We must carry [one]. If we don't, since the water is especially high, we
probably won't \{succeed in damming/ be able to dam\} [the stream].

\. C: Well then, one path [to take is that] we'll probably have to dam one or two
sections of this fork in the stream \footnote{lɔ-qa: a fork in a stream/river such that the two branches rejoin later.}.

1\. A: That's what we'll have to do. Both of you, mother and \{child \footnote{One of the women (``B'') has brought her small \{son/ child\} along}/son\},
go dam it properly upstream\footnote{The fuller form of this word is \textbf{g̈ɨ̀-ú} (lit. \texttt{"}water-head\texttt{"}).}. I'll do it downstream.

1\. B: I'll do it right, You wait for me the way you should \footnote{qha-dɛ̀ʔ (Adv.): A culturally important adverb, `properly; right; thoroughly;}.

1\. C: I suppose I should stay \{over there/ on that side\}.

1\. D: Wherever you \{plan to stay/ think of staying\}, that's just where you have
to dam it.

1\. B: Why don't you dam it on that side. Dam it on that side! That's where they
probably are, the fish.

1\. A: I'll dig some earth and/ to block it up for you.  You two, mother and child,
(go) pick up stones to \{pile/stack\} up.

1\. C: All right, I'll carry them and plaster \footnote{The idea is to plaster mud onto the pile of stones to impede the flow of water.} them up with all my might. \footnote{g̈â-thèʔ (Adv.): another culturally important adverb, very much like Japanese}

1\. A: Just do it properly! If you don't, how will we get anything to eat?

1\. C: (We've) just got to work our butts off \footnote{kɨ̄-ni  nā  pâʔ- šôʔ  te  ve: lit. ``do so that one's forehead drips} damming it! Even while \{we're/
I'm\} carrying \{our babies/ my baby\} and playing with \{them/ him\} \footnote{yâ- pû- yâ- qa (elab. adv.): have kids on one's hands to keep entertained.}

1\. B: I've got to do it even when my baby is waiting to eat!

2\. D: Yes, yes, my old man \footnote{lɔ̂- pū: \texttt{<} Chinese (Mand. lǎo-fù) ``old guy.'' Familiar ref.} is also waiting to eat at home.

2\. A: You, mother and child, dig up mud properly upstream and plaster it on. \footnote{The speaker adds ``you two mother and child'' as an afterthought after saying}
I'll go and dam downstream.

2\. C: Whew, I'm giving it all I've got.  And I'm hungry besides!

2\. A: Wow, the fork has been dammed just right! The water is nicely blocked off!

2\. Wowie, tons \footnote{a-cí-cí mâ hêʔ: lit. `not just a little bit', i.e., `lots and lots'.} of fish are coming down!

2\. Wowie zowie, \footnote{This extreme interjection is meant to convey the exaggerated intonation of} they're coming right into the fish basket! \footnote{thɛ-qō \textasciitilde{} phɛ-qō: huge basket, usually used for storing}

2\. It's full to the brim already!

2\. We can't even \{budge it/pick it up\}!

2\. Act fast! Hurry up and pick them up and come down here!

2\. My, my, my, they've climbed up here too!

3\. This is just what we've been looking for today.

3\. I'm so hungry, so let's do our best!

3\. A: My goodness, there are so many big hu-qɔ̀ʔ \footnote{A kind of small, edible, hard-to-catch fish, whose bite can inflict pain.} fish coming down---in
droves!

3\. Wow, how are the two of you doing? \footnote{Lit., ``How are the two of you doing to eat?'' i.e., what are you doing that}

3\. Hurry up and come here now---hurry up and come!

3\. B: I don't think they [the fish] are going down[stream]---I think they're probably
going up.

3\. A: No, no! Hurry and come down---just come down!

3\. B: From what I see it looks like they're climbing up!

3\. A: No! They are \textit{not} climbing up! Hurry and come down, the two of you,
mother and child!

3\. B: They came up, they came up, they came up! My God, to-da-a-y \footnote{yàʔ-hi lɛ̀ : the topic particle lɛ̀ is pronounced with very exaggerated} we got
so many you could die \footnote{An intensivizing expression g̈a  šɨ  e  yò, similar to Thai Vɨ \_ taaj.}!

4\. C: Do it fast, hurry and pick them up and come here!

4\. D: When we get home we'll eat up a storm \footnote{vâ is a verb (\texttt{<} Shan vǎŋ `strike, beat') usable as a substitute}!

4\. C: It's going to get dark soon.

4\. D: Even if it's dark we'll just light our way home with pine-torches.

4\. A: Just by damming this one form we probably got five or six kilos of fish!

4\. D: We sure did! Our old man will be happy---I bet they'll clap their hands
for joy tonight.

4\. B: Yeah, my old man will be so-o-o happy too---wow, I bet he'll be pacing back
and forth giggling \footnote{hɔ-hí hɔ-hí te ve (AE onomat + V) `giggle' [inadvertently left out of} all over the house! [laughter]

4\. D: [pretending to be home] Eat your fill, old man! I've come back! Eat all
you want! Here, eat up!

4\. B: Wow, today the fish didn't listen when the mother and child spoke.

49: [Since they didn't listen], we got five or six kilos of them, just today.

50: Oh boy, this big soft-shelled turtle \footnote{pa-tÁ ( \texttt{<} Tai). This turtle is classified as a fish (Si. plaa-)} is for my old man!

5\. D: Hey, old man, hurry and cook these up!

5\. Pick the big one for our kid and cook it properly for \{him/her\}.

5\. Cook the little one for the two of us to eat, mixed with Á-pɔ̂-g̈wɛ̂
