1. I'd just like to say a few words about the meeting that we held this year,
1965. , at Shatodu village.

2. This is the story.

3. All of us brethren---Karen, Lahu, white people---we all met together.

4. For that we greatly praise the grace of God.

5. Then, having met together we studied the Word of God.

6. The Words of God that we studied were in Ephesians 5:13.\footnote{In the King James translation, the verse is: ``But all things that are reproved are made manifest by thy light; for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.''}

7. Jesus is our chief.\footnote{\textbf{ó-qó}: `head; principal part'.}

8. We Christians must always rely upon\footnote{The Lahu verb is \textbf{cû}. For a study of its etymology, see JAM 1989: ``A new ST root \textbf{*d-yuk} 'belong/trust/depend/accept/take', and a note of caution to megalo-reconstructionists''.} Jesus.

9. That's the story.

10. May God's blessing be upon us forever!
