Dramatis Personae:

H = Headman Cà-bí

T = Teacher Cà-bo

P = Paul Cà-lɔ̂

\. H: Well now, if we talk about how the Lahu people set up a new village, it's
like this.

\. If the place where we live is not a good place for farming, for earning a living
from the land, if the place isn't good that's what we do!

\. Since we don't want to stay there, a new --- looking for a good new place for
\{growing crops/farming\} is what we call ``setting up a new village,'' this time
in a good place.

T: \. Well then, haven't you been talking and talking this year about going up
north there to Nâ-qhày?\footnote{This location remains to be identified.}

\. Isn't that right?

\. Isn't it said that there are irrigated fields up there --- that's what they're
saying.

H: \. I've gone there. We've already gone to look and see whether they have irrigated
fields.\footnote{Note the sequence of Pv's Á ò šɔ̄. Á (\textasciitilde{} tā) `durative'}

\. Everything there is \{just great/ very pleasant

\. The houses there are very nice too.

T: 1\. If you \{pay attention/listen\} to what people say, they're saying that
there's not even any water there!

H: 1\. For God's sake,\footnote{pòthôo: a Tai-derived interjection (``by the Buddha!''), used frequently} as far as water goes, there's a river called Yɛ̂-nâ\footnote{To be identified.}
which comes down from the high mountains [with so much water that you can't use
it all]. \texttt{<}Inaudible --- my guess as to what the missing words are ---
check MM's transcription\texttt{>}

1\. It's very good. [But] down below to the south, there is a foamy place in the
river\footnote{g̈ɨ̀-phû-twɛ̂ʔ: see DL 1145.} where the water doesn't reach, in the hot season.

T: 1\. They've gone and lied to you, I bet --- and you're also lying! [inaudible
words]

H: 1\. I'm not lying. I've gone to see it and come back!

1\. Didn't you \{just/recently\} see me [coming back]?

T: 1\. Oh.

P: 1\. When you guys set up a new village, what sort of things do you \{consider/
look at\}? [inaudible words]

1\. Whether it's a place where you can get water \{easily/ properly\}, or whether
it's very high up in the mountains, or whether there are lots of trees around?

1\. Whether it's an easy place to \{come and go on the paths/walk back and forth\}?

2\. What are all the kinds of things that you consider before setting it up, setting
up a village like this?

T: 2\. Well, as for that ---

P: 2\. In other words, whether it's a place where it's pleasant and good to live?

H: 2\. That's right.

2\. [When] setting up a village, all the good points --- er, of --- you have to
consider the good points before setting up a village, they say.

2\. If it's good for \{agriculture/cultivation/farming\}, if water is plentiful,
if everything is \{easy/convenient\}, then we'd set up a village.

T: 2\. [Where] there's plenty of game and fish.

H: 2\. It's easy, if it's like that.

T: 2\. We're looking for someplace where it's easy to dam up a stream, to hunt
for crabs!

2\. When we Lahu are looking for a place for a village ---

P: 3\. Water --- if it's far from a place where you can draw water to drink you
probably can't \{do/ make a go of\} it.

T: 3\. If it's far from where you draw water to drink, you can't.

3\. Our Lahu ancestors used to suffer\footnote{bɔ̀ à: lit. ``were tried out''.} from that!

3\. Since you drink water day after day, if there's no water nearby you can't \{make/
do\} it!

P: 3\. Like when there aren't very many trees, right?

T: 3\. Yeah, right.

H: 3\. When there are lots of trees, it's easy to gather wood to burn, easy to
chop down bamboo, and \{everything/ all that\}.

P: 3\. So, looking at that sort of thing, considering all that, you get to set
it \texttt{<}a new village\texttt{>} up.

H: 3\. Mm-hm.

P: 3\. Why is it that when the Lahu set up a village, every year, every time, they
only set up in the mountains?

4\. Why don't they go look [for something] in the plains?

4\. Oh, the plains are tough, for us Lahu it's tougher.

4\. Since even in \{older times/ the old days\} we never used to get to do it or
get ahold of [anything].\footnote{g̈a te ve `get to do'; cɔ̀ la ve `come to have'. I.e., we never managed}

4\. [inaudible, something to do with diseases in the plains] ... it's hard!

P: 4\. Oh, you are talking about malaria.\footnote{nà phə̂ʔ ve: have any serious disease associated with living in the plains,}

T: 4\. Yes. When we have chills and fever, there's no money to buy medicine to
take, for us hillfolk.

4\. Well then, our real dwelling place is up there in the high reaches\footnote{yɛ̂ qhɔ: `in the upper reaches of the hills' (yɛ̂ `high cold area, very} where
the mountains are high, yeah, where there are plenty of gibbons, plenty of squirrels\footnote{fâʔ-thɔ̂ʔ `common squirrel' [Callosciurus sp.]},
lots of red-cheeked ground squirrels\footnote{fâʔ-šwɛ [Dremomys rufigiensis].}!

4\. We love to live in places like that!

4\. That's what we've been looking for now.

H: 4\. Yes indeed, that's the way it is!

5\. [But] now [inaudible] ... you guys haven't gotten up there.\footnote{I.e., up to Nâ-qhày [sentence \#4].}

5\. If you haven't been there, you don't know.

5\. I've been there already!

5\. I've looked it over \{carefully/ properly\}!

P: 5\. Well, when you make a village, how do you divide up the land --- I mean
places where you'll build a house?

H, T\} 5\. Well ---

P: 5\. Whatever place each person wants to get, he gets; he can just go look at
it and take it\footnote{There is a 4-verb concatenation here: g̈a ca ni yù (g̈a `be able', ca `go}, is that right?

T: 5\. Yep. Whatever place each person wants, if the place pleases him he goes
and takes it.

P: 5\. ``I'll build in this place, I'll build a house\footnote{yɛ̀ te ve (OV) `build a house' (``make a house''), te (V) `do; make'.} in this place, in that
place I'll make a garden'' --- is that how it's done?

H: 5\. Yes, yes, yes.

P: 6\. When you build a house, how do you do it?

6\. Like, do you help each other, one person to another?

6\. Or else does each person build his own house by himself?

6\. Oh when we build houses, we certainly help each other!

63a. During the year when we're going to set up [a new village] we can't [not]
help each other.

6\. If each person does everything he's supposed to do, if [he does] what he ought
to do all by himself, then the whole village will pitch in and help him.\footnote{A three-verb concatenation: phôʔ ga pî (phôʔ `do in a group', ga `help',}

6\. Sometimes we can manage to do it in a single day, building a house.

P: 6\. You can do it in only one day?

T: 6\. Yes.

P: 6\. So then in order to build the bases of a whole village properly, I wonder
how many days, how many months it takes.

T: 6\. Oh, it doesn't take many months, you know.\footnote{The 2nd person pronoun nɔ̀ is added as an afterthought at the end of the}

P: 7\. In order for everybody to have a proper house to live in!

T: 7\. If everybody properly \{puts his effort into building/ concentrates on\}
his own house, it wouldn't even take a month.

7\. It could \{take/be done in\} between one and two weeks.

P: 7\. So when the houses are all built, it's like what other people call it, isn't
it?

7\. [I mean,] in Shan and Northern Thai they call it ``eating a new village,''
don't they, and they have a \{festival/big party\}.

T: 7\. Well, as for that ---

P: 7\. Don't they call it ''climbing up into a new house''?

T: 7\. We ``grace-begging'' Lahu \footnote{šú-tɔ̂(n)-pā: lit. ``those who \{beg/pray\} for grace.'' Epithet used} don't do it that way.

7\. As for climbing up into a new house, before other people can climb into it,
he [the owner] himself has to go climb up and sleep in it first!

7\. That's what other people say about us Lahu.

P: 8\. Don't other people call it khyn hə́n mài?\footnote{This is the Shan expression that means ``climbing into a new house,'' equivalent}

H: 8\. Well, that's Shan ---

T: 8\. In the Shan language they say khyn hə́n mài.

8\. We Lahu call it yɛ̀-ší tâʔ ve,\footnote{This is a literal equivalent of the Tai expression.} but before anybody else can climb
up, he himself [the owner] must climb up first, before \{anybody else/other people\}.

P: 8\. Right

T: 8\. Well, I've heard that your village,\footnote{Even though teacher and Headman really live in the same village (Huey Tat),} when [you] said ``let's go up there,''\footnote{To check out nâ-qhày. See sentence \#4.}
some people --- some wanted to go, but some didn't want to go!

8\. I just don't know what we, the two of us, can do with people like that [who
don't want to go].

H: 8\. Everybody will go.\footnote{qay tù ve dê yò: dê is here a rare non-reduplicated occurrence of dê-dê} They'll go \{slowly/in their own sweet time\}.

T: 8\. If \{they take so much time about it/``it's slowly-slowly''\} \{in the future/later
on\} if somebody doesn't get a good place they'll \{scold/curse\} people!

H: 8\. Well, as for that, the land is broad!

9\. Land, now, the land you [could] have to live on, there's so much of it that
you could never run out of places to live!\footnote{mâ chɛ̂ pə̀: ``not finish living''.}\footnote{Unfortunately this has not been true for the past several decades, as overpopulation}

T: 9\. I'm afraid that \footnote{à-mù (conj.) `lest; or else' (unpleasant hypothesis). See DL 100-101.} a --- if it's not a good place, \{he/a person\} wouldn't
want to live there.

H: 9\. If he doesn't want to live there, \{let him just/just let him\} not go!

9\. It's up to him!

T: 9\. You're being unreasonable \footnote{chɔ khô â hêʔ, lit. ``it isn't human speech''.} about this!

H: 9\. I'm right! [INAUDIBLE: ``he took yours, yours'']

T: 9\. Well, the two of us can't do anything about it.

H: 9\. So somebody who hasn't come yet---

9\. So if anybody doesn't want to come,\footnote{The deictic viewpoint has now changed from going to the new village (qay)} wherever he wants to live in the future
is up to him!

T: 9\. But if unfortunately [somebody] should be unhappy, even somebody who had
gone up there before other people, he might someday [want to] come back again!

10\. It's tough for us Lahu people.

H: 10\. Oh, if they manage to stay there and not come back, they can make a go
of it up there.

102 All of you guys, if you manage to go, you're called men, so you must come to
a decision!

10\. You're not \{children/kids\}! Don't fool around!\footnote{qôʔ gɨ̂, `say for fun; talk thoughtlessly'.}

T: 10\. Men, men so-called, flap their mouths a lot,\footnote{mɔ̀ʔ-qɔ vây ve: lit. ``fast in the mouth''.} you know.

H: 10\. They won't go back. So we've got to talk things through to a conclusion.

10\. Whatever we do, let's go and do it, okay?

10\. \{But/otherwise\} don't keep talking thoughtlessly and arguing with each other!

10\. There's no \{point/advantage\} in arguing.

10\. I told you that if you wouldn't go before, don't go at all, but you wouldn't
listen.\footnote{CHECK. This sentence has an anomalous pî instead of lâ for 3-\texttt{>}2}

11\. And now you saw you won't go.

11\. Aren't you a man then?

T: 11\. What I said was, if I \{would/were to\} go, every last person should go.

H: 11\. They will go, every last one of them.

11\. Even if they wouldn't go before, now they'll go.

T: 11\. I tell you they won't go, that bunch of them.

H: 11\. If they don't go, afterwards [those who have gone] will say ``Come!'',
that's what they'll say.

11\. Yes, once you've gone and looked over the good land for cultivation,\footnote{g̈a câ kɨ̀ (Ndeclaus): ``place to get to eat'', i.e., `place to earn a} the
really fine [land], you won't want to leave [qay].

11\. I myself, when I went there to look it over a while ago, I said to them [those
in Nâ-qhà], ``If they [from Huey Tat] don't come [qay], don't worry about it.''\footnote{mâ qay qo tâ ni qôʔ pî ve: here ni `look at' seems to mean `pay attention}

11\. What will those who have seen it do?\footnote{ni ò ve ɔ̄ qhà-qhe te è: i.e., it's more important to consider what those}

12\. \{As for me, I have/I myself have\} never been there, so I'll listen to what
you say and go.

12\. Then if the time comes when there's nothing to eat, you'll know about it.

H: 12\. If you don't do it you'll starve anyway.

Somebody else: 12\. They've gone already, they've gone already! You deep thinkers\footnote{dɔ̂꞊nÁ-lɨ̂ʔ ve: lɨ̂ʔ (Vadj) `deep' \texttt{<} Tai; nÁ (Vadj) is}
have gone already!

T: 12\. All of them are just following their hearts!\footnote{ni-ma-qa-pɨ tí tɛ̂ʔ ve: ``only measure their hearts''.}

[12\. yɔ̂-hɨ a-cí cɔ̀ lɛ --- à-mù a-cí ... gà la ve mâ hêʔ] UNINTELLIGIBLE

Somebody else: 12\. ... Can you guys \{live/make a living\} there?

H: 12\. You mean growing crops?

12\. The new rice, the \{first fruits/new crops\} are just coming out now.

12\. If you want to have an increase in rice production.\footnote{nɔ̀-hɨ \{ɔ̀ʔ=ɔ̄\} mâ la gâ ve qo ɔ̄.}

T: 13\. That's fine then, if that's the way it is.

13\. What kind of fields\footnote{à-thòʔ-ma ca te câ: short for \textasciitilde{} ca te câ kɨ̀ ``what} do you say they have up there?

13\. Do you say swiddens or paddy-fields?

13\. They intend to \{do/cultivate\} paddy fields. The first year I went there
they were still living \{from/off\} swiddens in the high mountains.

13\. While they were (still) cultivating swiddens they [also] worked paddy-fields.

P: 13\. What kinds [of crops] will you plant to eat?

H: 13\. After we prepare the paddy fields we'll plant rice; we'll cultivate swiddens
in the hills, and make \{gardens/plantations\} to grow several kinds of things,
and make shit-bean\footnote{nɔ̂ʔ-qhɛ̂ (also nɔ̂ʔ-kɨ̂ ``rotten beans''): kind of soybean fermented} fields.

13\. We'll \{plant/grow\} \{maize/corn\}, bananas, and sugar-cane!

13\. All kinds of pumpkins.

13\. We'll earn plenty of money up there, I tell you.

T: 14\. [INAUDIBLE] ... qhe te qay tù ve qôʔ-qo-pɔ̀ʔ.

14\. The plains up there in the Nâ-qhày valley are excellent, they say.

14\. Other people haven't worked then, so I'll just do it myself.

P: 14\. Are you saying you claimed\footnote{vɛ (V) `lay claim to something, usually by leaving a visible symbol of ownership'.} [that land] first?

T: 14\. I have claimed it already.\footnote{hɔ̂ lɛ̀ʔ ve: `sell in order to eat', i.e., ``sell to earn (money) to}

H: 14\. But then you won't be able to cultivate all of it by yourself.

14\. You should just cultivate enough for one person to manage \{easily/carefully\}.

T: 14\. I want to earn money by selling\footnote{The Teacher is playing different roles in this conversation---before he was} [stuff] to others.

H: 14\. So you'll sell for a living.

14\. But you don't have the government's permission, I'll bet.

T: 15\. Down there on the high ground above the river there won't be anybody who
could climb up onto the bank on the rocky side to grab it for himself.

15\. So I've claimed it, down there.

H: 15\. There's plenty \texttt{<}of land\texttt{>} around the rocky cliff, so you
go ahead and claim some!

15\. Wherever you want to claim, claim it!

15\. There's lots of it [land]. We can't use it all up. [INAUDIBLE WORDS]

15\. The Akha\footnote{tɔ́-kɔ in notebook, but the correct form is tɔ̀-kɔ.} guy said, just you look at it, look at it ... [words missing]
it's good.

15\. Plenty of game, plenty of monkeys, even if you want to eat fish, for God's
sake!\footnote{pòthôo: `by the Buddha'. The X'n Lahu have adopted this Tai expletive.}

15\. When you go there, even though it's \{in/called\} the mountains [the terrain]:
it doesn't go up and down.

15\. It's flat and smooth --- wherever you go it's very easy, to earn a living!\footnote{ca câ ve: lit. ``seek to eat, look for a living''.}[44a]

Somebody: 15\. When I went there recently I was awful\footnote{šɨ-e-lɛ-yò `so much one could die'; verb intensifier, probably calqued} thirsty!

T: 16\. Listen, listen, listen to him!

H: 16\. You're going to be really hot down there, in the plains, in the hot season.
[sentence invented by Jim]

T: 16\. ... It's not flat land. How are we ever going to \{make a go of/earn our
living from\} cultivating paddy-fields?

H: 16\. Up there, over there ... in the riverbed they've channeled [the water]
as it falls from the high mountains so that when it reaches down below there's
so much water that you can't see it all.

16\. The Nâ-qhày River is no small thing.\footnote{mâ ɨ̄ ve mâ hêʔ: ``is not the case that it is not big.''}

16\. It has two valleys, Mɛ-thà-lây and Kɛ̀-pa-tâwʔ.\footnote{\texttt{<} Thai kɛɛ̀ŋ-pan-tÁw (kɛɛ̀ŋ `cataract').}[47a]

[16\. Paddy-fields ... [partly inaudible] you can't even cross them when it rains.]

T: 16\. Not long ago a bunch --- a bunch of us went there, we had been sent to
look it over, and Nâ-qhày was just floating knee-deep in sand!

H: 16\. That's because the water has come flowing down, and it's [made the land]
nice and fertile.

16\. So you can have paddy-fields.\footnote{Paddy-fields, being irrigated, require a handy water-source.}

17\. In the hot season it's all sand, there's no water down there.

T: 17\. With sand \{you can't plant anything/whatever you plant is no good\}.

H: 17\. It's fine! That's just where to plant crops.

17\. Other people are earning a living [there]. You just go and check it out.

P: 17\. Isn't it far from a road for cars, your place?

H: 17\. Cars can get all the way to it up there.

T: 17\. So cars can get all the way up there, you say!

P: 17\. Then that's great for you!

H: 17\. That senior headman\footnote{kānān (\texttt{<} Thai kamnan): a senior headman whose jurisdiction is} up in Nâ-qhày, what was his name now? I've forgotten
it!

[Something inaudible said by somebody else]

H: 17\. Yeah, there are a whole group of senior headmen there.

18\. They have cars, big trucks,\footnote{lɔ̄lī (\texttt{<} Brit. Eng. lorry): `motor vehicle (of any kind)'. A} my God, lots of them!

T: 18\. Their cars, they have two of them,\footnote{nî khɛ: the animal classifier khɛ is used to count motor vehicles.} I tell you!

P: 18\. So we Lahu will probably get to ride in them, I bet.

H: 18\. We'll get to ride, we'll get to ride! Up there [inaudible].

P: 18\. Whereabouts would you go to market, if you wanted to go to a [Thai] marked?
To Chiangdao?\footnote{A town about 60 km. north of Chiang Mai, on the road to Farng.}

H: 18\. \{Up there/To the north), way up there, you come to Farng.\footnote{A large town about 120 km. north of Chiang Mai.}

\{Simultaneous: T: 18\. Oh, you'll get to come around to the area aroun Farng!

\{Simultaneous: P: 18\. Oh, the Farng area, is it?

H: 18\. Up there in the city there's a road which goes through to a place where
there's a big rice-mill, right up there!

18\. As for a market, there's a big entrance to it in Farng.

T: 19\. Oh, I see.

P: 19\. So you come to the Farng market and go right in, is that right?

19\. To buy things.

H: 19\. Yeah, we go buy things, whatever, all kinds of stuff to go buy.

19\. You can even buy \{an ox/a cow\} to raise.

19\. It's very easy to get an oxcart to pull things for a living, up there!

P: 19\. Wow, that's probably all right then!

H: 19\. Mm-hm, you won't have to carry anything at all on your back to earn a living,
on the plains.\footnote{I.e., you can transport things by oxcart.}

19\. Staying here I don't see how we can survive!

19\. If we can just manage to settle up in that area.

T: 20\. As soon as one thing has been done and come to pass, and has almost succeeded,
another thing comes up to keep on doing.

20\. When one thing has come to pass and almost succeeded, another thing comes
up to keep on doing.\footnote{T. is repeating himself here.}

20\. I'll follow your advice,\footnote{nɔ̀ qhâ, lit. ``your way''.} I'll really just keep following your advice!

20\. Just this once [more] I'll be patient and try to follow your advice.

20\. But if that place also turns out \{to be a dud/not to work\}, I'll never take
your advice again!

H: 20\. We'll never leave again [if we move up there].

20\. If we do manage to get up there, we'll certainly\footnote{pə̂-lɛ (written pə̂-ê in notebook). Glossed `even so, anyway, at least'} stay there forever and
die there of old age!

20\. For our children's and grandchildren's generations.

20\. We have planned to make it succeed!

20\. We're \{not just toying\footnote{dɔ̂ gɨ̂: ``think for fun''.} with the idea!/really serious about it!\}
