{\Large{}\textbf{\#99 The Tiger in the Tobacco Pouch}}

{\Large{}1 Once there was a certain man.}

{\Large{}2 He was a tobacco-smoker.}

{\Large{}3 So he had all kinds of tobacco seedlings. [1]}

{\Large{}4 Well, he went looking for [a certain kind of] tobacco at a Shan's.}

{\Large{}5 Then he said to the Shan, ``Mister, don't you have any šú ɔ̀-ɛ́?''[2]}

{\Large{}6 At this the Shan said, ``What is this `šú ɔ̀-ɛ́'?'' [3], so he
repeated ``šú ɔ̀-ɛ́''.}

{\Large{}7 Then the Shan said to him,[4] ``Oh! [5] In that case don't up wrap it
yet, don't unwrap it yet!}

{\Large{}8 I'll go look for a policeman first!''}

{\Large{}9 Then, since the Shan hadn't understood, he unwrapped it and put it down
[for him to see] --- he'd been talking about tobacco seedlings!}
