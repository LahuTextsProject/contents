51 What is a Christian/Hymn

What is a Christian?

1 What is it that we call a real Christian?

2 A real Christian must not indulge in bad behavior.

3 He must not drink alcohol, he must not smoke opium, he must not gamble, he must
not plant opium.

4 Let us sing a hymn!

Hymn

1 How happy it is with Jesus, how happy with Jesus!

2 Let us praise his grace, let us exalt him in the highest!
