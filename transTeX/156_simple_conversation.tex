1. Cà-vàʔ: Have you gone swimming in the river yet?

2. Cà-g̈âʔ: I haven't swum yet.

3. P: Speak a little louder!

4. Cà-vàʔ: Where are you going today?

5. Cà-g̈âʔ: I don't have to go anyplace.

6. P: I'm certainly not going anywhere.

7. Cà-vàʔ: For my part, I want to go to the opium field!\footnote{This is said in jest, since all the participants in the conversation are Christians, for whom opium cultivation is forbidden.}

8. P: Who are you going with? Hurry up and say it, Cà-vàʔ.

9. Cà-vàʔ: I'm going with you!

10. P: Before this I never even got to go with you.

11. Cà-vàʔ: We're off to cultivate the opium field.

12. Cà-g̈âʔ: Where is it anyway?

13. Cà-vàʔ: It's at Na-li.

14. Cà-g̈âʔ: Haven't you finished cultivating it yet?

15. Cà-vàʔ: There's a little we still haven't finished.

16. Cà-g̈âʔ: How much still is left?

17. Cà-vàʔ: There's just a little left still! By tomorrow we'll have cultivated
enough.

18. Cà-g̈âʔ: So tomorrow you'll have it all done!

19. Cà-vàʔ: It'll be done. Tomorrow.

20. Cà-g̈âʔ: I'll be able to help you tomorrow too. Together with some of you.

21. Cà-vàʔ: Do help!

22. Cà-g̈âʔ: All this staying at home for one or two months, I got tired of
working in the swidden.

23. Cà-vàʔ: So come and help! Come help me cultivate tomorrow, just with me.

24. P: Hey Crocodile,\footnote{Paul is evidently calling \textbf{Cà-g̈âʔ} by this nickname.} tomorrow are you going to help along with me then?

25. Cà-g̈âʔ: I will help you a little bit. I've been such a lazybones this year.

26. P: So if you all are going to help I'll help, me too.
