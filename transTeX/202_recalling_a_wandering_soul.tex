\textbf{\#202 Recalling a Wandering Soul}

1 Haw, O, O!  This night is indeed an auspicious one!

The other day this man's soul went away in a direction where it has suffered much
trouble .\footnote{The specialist who recorded this prayer said the soul of his patient had wandered away into the jungle where it had no place to eat or sleep.}  Tonight come back along these silver steps, come back along these
golden steps.\footnote{A poetic reference to symbolic steps carved in wood.}

2 Come back again into the four corners of the household, come back to the guest's
side of the fireplace, come back to the household head's side of the fireplace.
