{\LARGE{}\textbf{121 A Smoker and a Non-Smoker Dispute a Pipe}}

{\LARGE{}<See also 82a for a longer version>}

{\LARGE{}1. Well, I'll just tell a story about a smoker and a non-smoker in the
old days, okay?}

{\LARGE{}2. To all of you.}

{\LARGE{}3. Once upon a time a person who was not a smoker saw somebody else's
beautiful pipe and coveted it     }

{\LARGE{}very much, wanting badly to get it for himself.}

{\LARGE{}4. This smoker was very happy with his pipe.}

{\LARGE{}5. Well, one day, since the non-smoker wanted to get that [so badly],
he stole it and made off with it.}

{\LARGE{}6. Since he stole it, these two guys then went to court.}

{\LARGE{}7. These two people, the smoker and the non-smoker, went at each other
in a great court case.}

{\LARGE{}8. When they arrived at the official place [1] for their trial, they had
to litigate [2] for a very long time,     }

{\LARGE{}those guys.}

{\LARGE{}9. It could not be done for them quickly.}

{\LARGE{}10. When they got there the smoker had been very angry, since he treasured
his possession so much.}

{\LARGE{}11. The non-smoker wanted it badly, since the pipe was so beautiful, so
he stole it.}

{\LARGE{}12. So then having discussed it vigorously, and argued and argued with
each other, when they got to the       }

{\LARGE{}great courtroom, the officials [3] thought it over and instructed them
thus: ``If you are the smoker,       }

{\LARGE{}crumple up [4] the [right amount of] tobacco,'' they said.}

{\LARGE{}13. So they made the pipe-thief crumple tobacco, and also made the smoker
crumple tobacco, both of them.}

{\LARGE{}14. As for the non-smoker, the tobacco that he took and stuffed into the
pipe was way too much!}

{\LARGE{}15. It just wouldn't fit into the pipe when he tried to pack it in .[5]}

{\LARGE{}16. As for the smoker, he only stuffed a small amount into the pipe, so
it fit properly.}

{\LARGE{}17. So that non-smoker who desired somebody else's possession and stole
it did not win.}

{\LARGE{}18. He committed a grievous offense [6], not even being a smoker himself,
yet still desiring       }

{\LARGE{}another's possession and stealing it.}

{\LARGE{}19. When he was forced to stuff in tobacco, it was way too much, while
the smoker put in exactly        }

{\LARGE{}enough [7], so the smoker was able to get his pipe back.}
