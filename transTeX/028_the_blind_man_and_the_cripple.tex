{\LARGE{}28 The Blind Man and the Cripple}

{\LARGE{}or: The Advantages of Faith in Fortune-tellers}

{\LARGE{}or: The Power of Positive Thinking}

{\LARGE{}Huey Tat 3/9/65}

{\LARGE{}1. Once upon a time there were two people who were friends.}

{\LARGE{}2. One of them was blind, and the other was a cripple .[1]}

{\LARGE{}3. While the two of them were friends, one day they had an idea, and they
both went together to a fortune-teller [2] to ask how his eyes could come to see
and how his leg could become straight.}

{\LARGE{}4. When the two of them went to the fortune-teller, the fortune-teller
said to them, ``On your way going back, above you on the road when you see a bird's
nest in the crotch of a tree, make the blind man climb up and take it,'' he said.}

{\LARGE{}5. Just exactly as the fortune-teller had said, as the two of them were
going on their way, when the cripple looked upwards, he saw a bird's nest.}

{\LARGE{}6. Since he caught side of the bird's nest, he told the blind man to climb
up.}

{\LARGE{}7. The blind man said, ``Since my eyes don't see, I can't see all these
things.}

{\LARGE{}8. ``I can't climb up,'' he said.}

{\LARGE{}9. But the cripple said, ``You }{\LARGE{}\textit{can}}{\LARGE{} climb
up.}

{\LARGE{}10. ``I'll show you how,'' he said.}

{\LARGE{}11. As the blind man was climbing, at a certain moment he asked, ``Have
I reached it yet?''}

{\LARGE{}12. But his friend said, ``You're not there yet.  Keep on climbing a little.''}

{\LARGE{}13. After he had climbed some more, when he [the blind man] asked again,
he [the cripple] said ``You've gotten there!'' .}

{\LARGE{}14. When he said ``You got there!'' since he [the blind man] really wanted
to see, he opened his eyes wide with all his might, and all of a sudden his eyes
could see again!}

{\LARGE{}15. In just the same [magical] way, when he took the bird's eggs in his
hand, these eggs turned into a snake, so because he was so terrified he dropped
it right towards the place where his friend was sitting, at which point his friend
also became terrified, so he suddenly jumped up and his leg straightened out.}

{\LARGE{}16. So then, we Lahu of this generation also ought to learn from these
two people and take it to heart .[3]}

{\LARGE{}17. Since they heeded the words of the fortune-teller, we've learned that
even the blind man got to see again.}

{\LARGE{}18. We've learned also that the cripple's leg straightened out.}

{\LARGE{}19. Everybody who takes good advice, their descendants and all of their
relatives as well, if they take all this to heart it will be good.}

{\LARGE{}20. Thus our Lahu ancestors told us long ago.}
