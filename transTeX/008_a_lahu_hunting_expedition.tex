3: Well then, where shall all of us in the village go hunting today anyway?

4: Well, there at the Metalai [stream]. From above Red Rock to below Red Rock,
then on down. We'll chase them down from above Metalai to Khɨ́-yɨ̄-kwì \footnote{This place-name means 'Hognosed Deer' [\textit{Cervus porcinus}].},

the place where Lawjo the Postman \footnote{This man was a friend of the Huey Tat villagers who used to be a postman in Shan State.} shot the mountain-goat that time.

5: Mm.

6: Where shall each of us go to lie in ambush \footnote{\textbf{nâʔ ve}  'to lie in wait in order to ambush the game.' One hunting party typically flushes the game while the others lie in ambush at various places, waiting for a chance to chase it (\textbf{g̈àʔ ve}).}?

7: Me, I'll go wait at the hill near Hognose Deer Valley.

8: I'll go wait at Goat-shoot .\footnote{\textbf{hâ bɔ̂ʔ kt̀}: the scene of Lawju's exploit.}

9: Down there, eh? I'm going to wait at the big stamping-ground right at the fork
in the Hognose Deer River.

10: I see.

11: Well, as far as I'm concerned--I'll go wait at Goat-shoot.

12: Hm. Well, you guys drive them well now!

13: Hey, hey! Today I'm going hunting! Let's ambush 'em the right way! Everybody
in his own ambush-point, lie in wait properly!

14: Right!

15: Well, now we're off to the hunt!

16: (Two voices) Right!

17: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!  Cho, cho, cho, cho, cho, cho,
cho! Oh, we've flushed a wild pig! We've flushed a boar, we've flushed a boar!

Come on, let's track him right! Everybody at his ambush-point, track him down right!
We've flushed a boar! Ah, here come the dogs to help us look, too!

18: Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof!

19: Here he goes, there he goes, there he goes! Cho, cho!

<A shot rings out>

20: What happened? Did they get him?

21: Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof!

22: Well, I think we hit him at least. But the bullet wasn't big [enough]! And
\textit{his} gun jammed, damn it.

23: The bullet drew a little blood. Come on, you dogs! Try to stick right on his
trail, try to stick right on his trail. Come on!

24: The gun-setting probably wasn't big [enough]--on \textit{your} gun.

25: Er--about my gun-setting--it was set for the squirrel-shooting that I did a
while back, that's why.

26: Oh, no! We won't get anything to eat then. Here we've been hunting all day
long today, but you guys set your guns so small,

all the trouble we went to was for nothing! We won't get a thing to eat. Try to
stick to his trail at least!  It's a bad business.\footnote{\textbf{chə̀ ve} 'to be all right; to work; be O.K.' \textbf{chə̀ tù mâ hêʔ} 'it's no good'.}

27: we won't get a thing to eat. We won't get a thing to eat! You failure! You
ass! You slob!

28: Ha, ha, ha.

29: Setting his gun that way!

30: Hey, down there in the river valley the dogs are quiet all of a sudden!

31: Hurry, let's go look! Hurry up, let's go take a look!

32: The dogs are quiet! Hurry come look, hurry come look!

33: Down there, down below; the dogs are quiet all of a sudden!

34: Well, let's go have a look.

35: What's going on?

36: Oh! It dropped dead here! It died here!

37: Shout to them! To everybody who's still up there on the mountain.

38: Hey, come on! Get down there, they say! The boar dropped dead here! Call out
to them, to everybody who's still up there on the hill! Come quick!

Here's where we got him, they say! Here's where the boar died! Hurry up and come!
Get a move on!

39: Chop down some leaves, chop down some leaves! We'll divide him up right away.
