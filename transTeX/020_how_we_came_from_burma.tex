\textbf{20 How We Came from Burma}

1 When we were fleeing here to Thailand from where[1] we used to live in Burma,
when we were fleeing here along the roads and byways, we lived off jungle-greens[2]
and by damming streams for fish as we came -- that's how we made it here.

2 And there was a big flock of kids along, too -- er, walking along --.

3 And we had to stay on the road a very long time, too.

4 Getting here[3], when it had gotten to be over a month, we had come as far as
Thayakwei,[4] where we made camp.

5 Looking for banana tree creepers[5] to live off and damming forks in streams,
that's how we got here.

6 We made it to Thailand.

7 [whisper] Think carefully before you speak![6]

8 Fleeing here from Burma we crossed the Nam-Si river[7] over to this side.

9 The time we stayed at Thayakwei was about two months -- we were there for two
months.

10 When we were there --

11 [whisper] Don't laugh![8]

12 -- we were all suffering from hunger and cold.

13 We would go and eat the other Lahus' mustard-greens.[9]

14 We'd go and eat their rice.

15 We were at Thayakwei for two months.

16 We would chop down sticky rattan[10] to eat.

18 We'd go eat banana plants.

19 We'd dam for fish to eat.

20 We came here begging for something to eat.[11]

21 After[12] staying there for a long time[13]\textsuperscript{ we continued on
to Shajieh.[14] }

\textsuperscript{22 When we arrived at Shajieh we and the Chinese -- er, all the
Chinese welcomed us gladly and cheerfully, and set down cups of tea[15] for us
to drink. }

\textsuperscript{23 And they fed everybody rice, too. }

\textsuperscript{24 After we ate we took to the road[16] again, until we got to
the village of Pomu[17] over there, where we stayed and spent the night, and we
Lahu traded all sorts of things with them for food.}

\textsuperscript{25 We traded away our silver buttons,[18] and even our bracelets
we traded away to fill our bellies.[19]}

\textsuperscript{26 We had nothing left. }

\textsuperscript{27 In poverty and distress we were begging for our food.}

\textsuperscript{28 Then our brethren who were already living here in Huey Tat[20]
came to lead us here. }

\textsuperscript{29 They came for us. }

\textsuperscript{30 They came to lead us here and they took care of us joyfully
and gladly, and so we arrived here at Huey Tat. }

\textsuperscript{31 Having to flee here was a very distressing time for us.[21]}

\textsuperscript{32 In the midst of our troubles we had been separated from one
another.[22]}

\textsuperscript{33 So inasmuch[23] as we have finally, by the grace of God, managed
to see each other again, we now have great and abundant reason to praise God. }

\textsuperscript{34 That's all there is to say.}
