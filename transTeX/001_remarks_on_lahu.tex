{\large{}Suggested new title:  }{\large{}\textit{Where the Thai Lahu came from}}

\. I'd like to tell you something now about the Lahu people.

\. In the past the people called Lahu were not folks who lived here in Thailand.

\. They were people who lived in Burma.

\. But if one asks why they came here to Thailand to live, it's just as you all
know/

you all know [the answer] very well.

\. Burma right now is not a country where you can live comfortably.

\. It's not like in the past when everybody could think what they wanted and do

what they wanted!

\. It's because ever since the new policy of Red China has come out/has been put

forth nobody can do what they want to do.

\. So since you can't do as you like, the people are unhappy.

\. So I think that's why you all came fleeing here.

1\. The thing is, even some of the Lahu living in Burma were not really people

who used to live in Burma from times past.

1\. They used to live in China, in a place called Yunnan Province.

1\. As for why they came to live in Burma, two or three hundred years

ago they came down from China, fleeing down into Burma.

1\. When they came fleeing down into Burma they also really suffered a lot.

1\. So then after living a while in Burma, soon the Burmese government, that

Burmese regime, came out with those Chinese-type rules, so the Lahu came

fleeing down into Thailand, like the Shan.

1\. Lots of Lahu, Lisu, and Chinese have come fleeing down into Thailand.

1\. The reason why they've come fleeing down here is the same for everybody.
