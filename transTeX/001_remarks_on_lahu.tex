{\large{}Suggested new title:  }{\large{}\textit{Where the Thai Lahu came from}}

1. I'd like to tell you something now about the Lahu people.

2. In the past the people called Lahu were not folks who lived here in Thailand.

3. They were people who lived in Burma.

4. But if one asks why they came here to Thailand to live, it's just as you all
know/

you all know [the answer] very well.

5. Burma right now is not a country where you can live comfortably.

6. It's not like in the past when everybody could think what they wanted and do

what they wanted!

7. It's because ever since the new policy of Red China has come out/has been put

forth nobody can do what they want to do.

8. So since you can't do as you like, the people are unhappy.

9. So I think that's why you all came fleeing here.

10. The thing is, even some of the Lahu living in Burma were not really people

who used to live in Burma from times past.

11. They used to live in China, in a place called Yunnan Province.

12. As for why they came to live in Burma, two or three hundred years

ago they came down from China, fleeing down into Burma.

13. When they came fleeing down into Burma they also really suffered a lot.

14. So then after living a while in Burma, soon the Burmese government, that

Burmese regime, came out with those Chinese-type rules, so the Lahu came

fleeing down into Thailand, like the Shan.

15. Lots of Lahu, Lisu, and Chinese have come fleeing down into Thailand.

16. The reason why they've come fleeing down here is the same for everybody.
