23 Candid Conversation: Warming up for one of the first recording sessions.

``H'' Headman: [explaining how playlets are acted out for recording---e.g., suppose
we pretend we're buying baskets]

\texttt{<}Playing role of buyer\texttt{>}

1a. We're recording.

1b. How much does one basket cost?

\. You carried them here on your shoulder \footnote{tâʔ ve: `carry on one's shoulder'}, right?

\. I'll act as if I'm your customer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\texttt{<}Playing role of seller\texttt{>}

\. Oh, let's say one basket costs five baht. \footnote{ŋâ bàʔ qo ŋâ bàʔ: lit. ``if it's five baht it's five baht.''}

\. If you want to \{get/buy\} a basket it's up to you.

\. As far as the price goes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\. Each person play a different part.

\. That's the way you speak, at the beginning [of the recording session].

\. Things---talk about the tools and utensils, all the kinds of things we use.

1\. All the kinds of baskets, right?---all the kinds of things we use, knives---

1\. Cà-bo ``(T)eacher'': This fellow now---[should take such-and-such a role]

1\. H: I'll speak first.

1\. T: Hey, blacksmith, forge a knife for me!

1\. H: [playing role of blacksmith] What kind of---what kind of knife?

14b. [whispers] Ask me another question?

1\. T: Oh, I'd like to have a portable \footnote{Á- thɔ pû tô  tù} knife.

1\.  ([whispers] Ask whether the head should be pointed or blunt.)

1\. H: Yeah, pointy-headed or blunt-headed?  Ask me \{another/something else\}.
Say you want one with a carved tip.

1\. Boy: Say you want a pointy one!

1\. T: Just ask something when you get an idea, and I'll answer you.

2\. Whatever you say, whatever you want to ask is up to you.

2\. Even if there's nothing to answer---

2\. H: You guys \footnote{Addressing those who aren't participating in the recording.} don't have other conversations, OK?

2\. T: In the same way, [let's talk about] everything you have to do when it's
time to build a house.

2\. We'll talk with each other so that each person will talk about a different
thing.

2\. There are several kinds of wood [involved].

2\. How we have to carry the house-posts. \footnote{From the forest to the village house-site}

2\. H: About killing pigs to eat.

2\. Do you want to \{get/record\} that first?

2\. Cà-lɔ̂: That too, after we've finished about house building, [then] all
this about killing pigs, OK?---and all about killing chickens to eat.

2\. All about going down to Chiang Mai to go shopping.

3\. How you go there, where you eat, where you spend the night how---

3\. OK, OK, OK, we'll help you, we'll help you.

3\. Cà-lɔ̂: How you ride [down there]---that sort of thing.

3\. That kind of thing isn't hard [to record extemporaneously].

3\. These are things that it's easy to think up.

3\. T: Talk about how much you have to pay for bus fare---oh, for one person it's
five and six baht \footnote{Five one way and six the other.}---damn expensive!

3\. Cà-lɔ̂: Whether that's a lot, or not a lot---

3\. T: Yes.

3\. Cà-lɔ̂: That business about quarreling with the bus driver---

3\. T: If it comes to five baht and six baht, altogether that's eleven baht---nobody
has ever had to pay that much [laughs].

4\. Cà-lɔ̂: The seats are no good either, you should say!

4\. T: Even so \footnote{qhe kàʔ: i.e., no matter how expensive it is} we don't even get to sit in a good seat, somebody should say.

4\. Cà-lɔ̂: Once you get there, how do you get off? \footnote{I.e., what do you do after you get off?}

4\. H: So then, I'll ask you things first, OK?

4\. I'll talk about all sorts of things---well---

4\. T: If one person can't answer, somebody else answer quickly!

4\. Think, and answer whatever you can manage to answer.

4\. H: About everything, right?  And no laughing!

4\. T: It doesn't matter if you laugh. Laughing---as kong as it's just a little
bit.

4\. I doubt we can do it without laughing. (laughter)

5\. H: Don't laugh, don't laugh, don't laugh!

5\. T: When it's time to laugh don't laugh all by yourself.

...

5\. Kachin: \texttt{<}getting into the mood\texttt{>}

Oh, say that the house-posts are all bent! (laughter)

5\. Cà-lɔ̂: The houseposts aren't driven in well!  They're not driven in properly!
That sort of thing.

5\. H: Don't laugh, be quiet!
