1. Once upon a time there was a great female crab.

2. She was a very big one.

3. She also had a lot of babies.

4. One day she led all her babies out and made them practice walking.

5. She was staying behind them and watching them carefully.

6. She made all her babies walk, one after the other, and as she looked at them,
they couldn't manage to walk

straight, they only went zigzag.

7. Then the mother said to her children, ``Children, that's not the way
to walk! Go \textit{straight}."

8. Then the children said, ``Well, Mother, please show us how.''

9. So this time it was the mother who went.

10. But even when the mother walked, she could only go zigzag, zigzag, zigzag,
just like her children.

11. Whereupon the children said, ``But, Mother, you go zigzag too, just
as we did! It's just the same!"

12. What can we learn from this, brethren?
