(Cà-bo)

1. This is a story about how God, once upon a time, after He had created Heaven
and Earth, gave out gifts [to all his creatures].

2. Once upon a time, after God had finished creating Heaven and Earth, He provided
all the things needed by all the people and creatures\footnote{\textbf{ɔ̀-cə̀} can mean either `things' or, in this context, `creatures'.} on earth, whether it was
all the human beings or all the kinds of animals, God created everything for them

3. After he finished creating all this], God spoke thus: ``Come take them, everybody's
things! Whatever it is [you] need.''

4. When he said this, all kinds of animals came.

5. The creatures who would bear horns took away their horns, and the creatures
who would bear fur took away their fur.

6. Having done all this, after each creature\footnote{The story-teller uses \textbf{g̈â} `classifier for humans', here extended to all God's creatures.} had carried everything off, for
the second time God called them together again [to give them gifts].

7. And so, when he said, ``Take it!'' they all came.

8. A certain woman came, and this is what she said:

9. ``I've heard that You have made something called a 'penis'.''

10. Then, at that point, when God said, ``OK, come take a penis that I've made,''
this woman suddenly ran up, and she grabbed a big horse penis that was there.

11. A penis that God had made.\footnote{Intending it for the horse.}

12. When God said, ``This one is not yours! This is for the horse!'' he threw it
onto the ground and stamped on it, so that's why [pubic] hair is all tangled and
bushy.

13. That's how the old story goes.

14. For the second time she said, ``We women are still not quite complete.''

15. ``Mine is still not quite complete.

16. ``Please add something,'' she once again went to beg of God.

17. Well, God cut off the tiny little glans\footnote{\textbf{nī} \textbf{ó-qō}: lit. ``penis-head.''} of a dog there, and threw it so
it stuck onto the woman.

18. Because of this, women have clitorises, it is said.

19. An old Lahu story tells it this way.

***

20. Now a second matter, the story about how the animals and the human beings had
a lawsuit with each other.

21. One day it happened this way.

22. The human beings and the animals took each other to court.

23. These animals went to God and said, ``Oh, those so-called humans of yours,
they're always shooting at us.

24. ``They don't even invite us [to make friends].

25. ``They don't treat us well at all.

26. ``All they do is shoot at us,'' they said.

27. ``You please teach them properly, those humans.''

28. So God asked the animals, he asked a certain barking-deer,\footnote{\textit{Cervulus muntjac}, known as the best eating in the jungle, now all but wiped out in Thailand.} ``Haven't they
invited you?'' he said.

29. When God asked him this, he said, ``As for inviting, they do invite us.

30. ``But when they invite us, they just strike out at us!

31. ``We don't have time to do anything [to escape them].''
