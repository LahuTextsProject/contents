\textbf{32 How Woman Got her Clitoris} and \textbf{The Lawsuit between the Animals
and the Human Beings}

(Cà-bo)

\. This is a story about how God, once upon a time, after He had created Heaven
and Earth, gave out gifts [to all his creatures].

\. Once upon a time, after God had finished creating Heaven and Earth, \{He/God\}
provided all the things needed by all the people and creatures\footnote{ɔ̀-cə̀ can mean either `thing' or, in this context, `creature'.} \{on earth/in
the world\}, whether it was all the \{human beings/people\} or all the kinds of
animals, God created everything for them.

\. After he finished creating [all this], God spoke thus: ``Come take them, everybody's
things! \footnote{Or ``Come everybody, take your things!''}  Whatever it is [you] need.''

\. When he said this, all kinds of animals came.

\. The creatures who [would] bear horns took away [their] horns, and the creatures
who [would] bear fur took away [their] fur.

\. Having done all this, after each creature \footnote{The story-teller uses g̈â `All for humans', here extended to all God's creatures.} had carried everything off, for
the second time God gave them [things] again.

\. And so, when he said, ``Take it!'' they [all] came.

\. A certain woman came, and this is what she said:

\. ``I've heard that You have made something called `a penis'.''

1\. Then, at that point, when [God] said, ``OK, come take a penis that I've made,''
this woman suddenly ran up, and she grabbed a big horse penis that was there.

1\. A penis that [God] had made. \footnote{Intending it for a horse.}

1\. When [God] said, ``This one is not yours! This is for the horse!'' he picked
it up [hurled/threw it] onto the ground and stamped on it, so that's why [pubic]
hair is all tangled and bushy.

1\. That's how the old story goes. \footnote{chɔ-mɔ̂-khɔ̂ `traditional saying/story'}

1\. A second thing---``We women are still not quite complete,'' they said.

1\. ``Our bodies are still not quite complete.

1\. ``Please add something,'' [they] once again went to beg [of God].

1\. Well, [the God] cut off the tiny little glans \footnote{nī ó-qō, lit. ``penis-head.''} of a dog there, and threw
it so it stuck onto the woman. \footnote{Not clear whether the whole group of women was so provided. Probably meant}

1\. Because of this, women have \{clitorises/clitorides\}, it is said.

1\. An old Lahu story tells it this way.

***

2\. Now a second matter, the story about how the animals and the human beings \{went
to court/ had a lawsuit\} with each other.

2\. One day it happened this way.

2\. The people/humans and the animals took each other to court.

2\. These animals went to God and said, ``Oh, those so-called humans of yours,
they're always shooting at us.

2\. ``They don't even \{call/ invite/ summon\} us [to make friends].

2\. ``They don't treat us [well] in any way at all.

2\. ``All they do is shoot at us,'' they said.

2\. ``You please teach them properly, those humans.''

2\. So God asked the animals, he asked a certain barking-deer, \footnote{\textit{Cervulus muntjac}, known as the best eating in the jungle, now all} ``Haven't they
invited you?'' he said.

2\. When God asked him this, he said, ``As for inviting, they do invite us.

3\. ``[But] when they invite us, they just strike out at us!

3\. ``We don't have time to do anything [to escape them].''
