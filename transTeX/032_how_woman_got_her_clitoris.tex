{\LARGE{}\textbf{32 How Woman Got her Clitoris}}{\LARGE{} and }{\LARGE{}\textbf{The
Lawsuit between the Animals and the Human Beings}}

{\LARGE{}(CÃ -bo)}

{\LARGE{}1. This is a story about how God, once upon a time, after He had created
Heaven and Earth, gave out gifts [to all his creatures].}

{\LARGE{}2. Once upon a time, after God had finished creating Heaven and Earth,
He provided all the things needed by all the people and creatures[1] on earth,
whether it was all the human beings or all the kinds of animals, God created everything
for them}

{\LARGE{}3. After he finished creating all this], God spoke thus: ``Come take them,
everybody's things! Whatever it is [you] need.''}

{\LARGE{}4. When he said this, all kinds of animals came.}

{\LARGE{}5. The creatures who would bear horns took away their horns, and the creatures
who would bear fur took away their fur.}

{\LARGE{}6. Having done all this, after each creature [2] had carried everything
off, for the second time God called them together again [to give them gifts].}

{\LARGE{}7. And so, when he said, ``Take it!'' they all came.}

{\LARGE{}8. A certain woman came, and this is what she said:}

{\LARGE{}9. ``I've heard that You have made something called a 'penis'.''}

{\LARGE{}10. Then, at that point, when God said, ``OK, come take a penis that I've
made,'' this woman suddenly ran up, and she grabbed a big horse penis that was
there.}

{\LARGE{}11. A penis that God had made. [3]}

{\LARGE{}12. When God said, ``This one is not yours! This is for the horse!'' he
threw it onto the ground and stamped on it, so that's why [pubic] hair is all tangled
and bushy.}

{\LARGE{}13. That's how the old story goes.}

{\LARGE{}14. For the second time she said, ``We women are still not quite complete.''}

{\LARGE{}15. ``Mine is still not quite complete.}

{\LARGE{}16. ``Please add something,'' she once again went to beg of God.}

{\LARGE{}17. Well, God cut off the tiny little glans [4] of a dog there, and threw
it so it stuck onto the woman.}

{\LARGE{}18. Because of this, women have clitorises, it is said.}

{\LARGE{}19. An old Lahu story tells it this way.}

{\LARGE{}***}

{\LARGE{}20. Now a second matter, the story about how the animals and the human
beings had a lawsuit with each other.}

{\LARGE{}21. One day it happened this way.}

{\LARGE{}22. The human beings and the animals took each other to court.}

{\LARGE{}23. These animals went to God and said, ``Oh, those so-called humans of
yours, they're always shooting at us.}

{\LARGE{}24. ``They don't even invite us [to make friends].}

{\LARGE{}25. ``They don't treat us well at all.}

{\LARGE{}26. ``All they do is shoot at us,'' they said.}

{\LARGE{}27. ``You please teach them properly, those humans.''}

{\LARGE{}28. So God asked the animals, he asked a certain barking-deer, [5] ``Haven't
they invited you?'' he said.}

{\LARGE{}29. When God asked him this, he said, ``As for inviting, they do invite
us.}

{\LARGE{}30. ``But when they invite us, they just strike out at us!}

{\LARGE{}31. ``We don't have time to do anything [to escape them].''}
