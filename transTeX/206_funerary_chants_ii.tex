\textbf{\#206 Funerary Chant  (II)}

1 Oh, oh, you are dead, go carefully to the land of the dead!

2 If you have brothers and sisters there, go to your brothers'  and sisters' place!

3 If you have a father and mother there, go to your father and mother's place!

4 Do not remain here!

5 Now if the sun is hot, fan yourself with this chicken wing of ours, and please
go!

6 And you can also scratch for water with this chicken's claw, so please go!

7 Pay for the boat fare with this piece of lead, and please go!
