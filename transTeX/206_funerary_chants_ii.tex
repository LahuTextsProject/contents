206 Funerary Chants II

1 Oh you are dead, go carefully to the land of the dead!

2 If you have relatives there, go to your relatives' place!

3 If you have a father and mother there, go to your father and mother's place!

4 Do not remain here!

5 Look now at this chicken wing; if the sun is hot, fan yourself and go!

6 Scratch for water with this chicken's claw and go!

7 Give this lead for the boat fare, the raft fare,\footnote{Here ``raft'' is simply the euphonic couplet to ``boat'': hɔ-phû-pɛ̂-phû.} and go!
