\textbf{\#138 Hymn: ``There the flowers do not wither``}

1  I am going to my home

2 There the roads are paved with gold

3 The eternal trees are abloom with flowers

4 There the flowers do not wither.

5 On earth there are many sorrows

6 In the great earth of the Evil One

7 We will be saved from temptation

8 There the flowers do not wither.

9 We will speak words of love with Jesus

10 We will be clothed in white garments with him

11 He is now waiting for me

12 There the flowers do not wither.

13 Chorus: Here flowers are beautiful only for a while

14 Soon flowers will wither away

15 I am going to my city \footnote{That is, the Celestial City of Heaven.}

16 There the flowers do not wither!
