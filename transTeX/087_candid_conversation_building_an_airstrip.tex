\textbf{87 Candid conversation before Building an Airstrip}

1a: I think this is funny.

1b: Don't laugh, mother!

2: I'll be the one who asks. You people will answer.

3: [About] how the airstrip is coming along--how building the airstrip is coming
along.

4: You people are now making a landing place for airplanes in Shatudeu village--

5: Don't \{do it / turn it on\} yet [=the tape-recorder]. We'll talk it over among
ourselves first.

Paul

6: O.K.

7: We'll talk t over first. Don't do it yet. '[We are] building an airstrip in
Shatudeu village.' '[Planes with] how many heads [=engines] do they say will be
able to land,' I'll ask you, all right? Then you guys will answer me, right? 'Three-engined
ones can land.'

8 :Say that we're making a landing place for ones with three engines. Think carefully
[before you speak]. Remember [what to say] and do it just exactly right! Otherwise
it could turn out the way it did before with Jamu's fatherNB--he got stuck and
didn't know what to say [Lit: his words were blocked]. (NB. The Lahu are teknonymous.)

9: One person can say what sort of thing it is that's called an 'airplane.' [Lit:
how it goes with an 'airplane']

Dav 10: Yes, we'll say that over here, then you both should continue talking on
that subject. Now this time keep everything in mind, please! [Laughs] In a minute
we'll do it [=record].

11: It's going in already! Listen! Into the hearing-machine. [=tape recorder]

Dav 12: I don't think it's going in yet. It's not going in yet. They're not doing
it yet.

13: Turn it on! We'll speak now.

Paul 14: How you can do [=record] it.

15: Can we do it already?

Dav 16: Just speak the way you planned it out a while ago, O.K.?

Paul 17: Talk as loud as you can, please.
