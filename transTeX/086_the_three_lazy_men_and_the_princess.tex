\textbf{\#86 C. The Smoker and the Non-smoker}

83 H: Well, once upon a time there were two men. 84 One of them was a tobacco-smoker,
he used to smoke all the time. 84 He was a great smoker. 85 The other one didn't
smoke. 86 His pipe--the smoker's pipe was a very fine one. 87 The inside[36] of
it was red and smooth, and it was streamlined[37] and shiny, so that the non-smoker
wanted to have it, and stole it away from him. 88 When he had gone and stolen it,
the two of them then [a few words are inaudible] and they make a big count-case[38]
out of it. 89 They made a big case of it, they were fighting with each other, and
(the time came that) they reached the great official--the lord--the king[39]--and
this king was a very shrewd man.[40] 90 He made the non-smoker \{make a / wad of\}
tobacco, to put in the pipe. 91 And he had the smoker crumple some tobacco too.
92 \texttt{"}Both of you crumple it and put it down here,\texttt{"} he said. 93
He didn't have them wad it up one tobacco--er, I mean one \textit{man} after the
other[42] [while they were there] together. 94 [Rather] he summoned one man at
a time and had him \{crumple it / wad it up\}--the tobacco. 95 Well, then, after
the tobacco had been wadded and placed [before him], he summoned the smoker. 96
\texttt{"}Come here, you!\texttt{"} he said to the owner of the pipe. 96 He came.
97 Then he summoned the one who had stolen the pipe too. 98 \texttt{"}Come here!\texttt{"}
he said. 99 \texttt{"}If you smoke a pipe--er, you, if the pipe is really yours,
try putting the tobacco you wadded into it,\texttt{"} he said.

100 When he said, \texttt{"}Try putting it in,\texttt{"} they went at it with a
will[43]--and the one the smoker had made[44] filled the bowl of the pipe perfectly.
101 The non-smoker's one was a big lump like this . . . [45] . . . because he didn't
know....

102 He was jealous of someone else's pipe, and stole it, and even made a court
case out of it and went before the king, but he couldn't win against the pipe-smoker!
103 THat fellow went and robbed someone else's property, went and stole someone
else's possession--104 Then, after he had coveted it and stolen it, when it came
to putting it to proper use,[46] he had no idea of how to do it. 105 When someone
forced him to make a wad for it, he crumpled up enough tobacco for \{anyone / a
person\} to put into \textit{two} pipes--he didn't know [\{how to do it / any better\}].
106 He wanted to get a hold of his pipe so he brought the fellow[46] to court,
thinking all the time[47] that if a serious issue were made of it[48] he would
win. 107 [But] it was in vain. 108 He went and stole another's property, and behaved
like a miserable wretch.[49] 109 But the real pipe-smoker, in joy and gladness,
got [back] his possession.[50]

110 That's right, my boys! \texttt{"}Don't go sitting on someone else's stool,\texttt{"}
as the saying goes. If it's not your own stool--

111 T-y: (Teasing) Did you say \texttt{"}don't go shitting\texttt{"} or \texttt{"}don't
go sitting\texttt{"}?[51]

112 Don't \textit{sit}, I said! That man who stole the pipe couldn't best the other
when it came right down to it, in the end.[52]

113 H: Mm-hm.
