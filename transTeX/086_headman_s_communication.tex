86 Headman's Communication at a Meeting in Church

Cà-bí (Huey Tat)

1. You women who have come, if there are people\footnote{I.e., your menfolk.} in your house, if there are
people who haven't come, please tell all of them about it, OK?

2. Among all of use \footnote{\textbf{nɔ̀-ŋà}꞊\textbf{hɨ}: lit ``you and me''. This is the way to} who make up this community, we're always overloaded with
all kinds of work, aren't we.

3. All the men, all the women, we always have work loaded upon us.

4. All kinds [of work].

5. These days when we're all so busy [with other things], even though there is
work to be done in the village, you brethren haven't had a chance to know about
it, right?

6. But now I'm going to tell you brethren [about it].

7. A while ago a preacher \footnote{This was a Karen pastor from a distant village.} was coming to visit us, so we were told ``Go and
welcome him.''

8. We had heard about this in advance, you see.

9. We were to go and welcome him.

10. We \{were supposed to/had\} to help him with all of his things.

11. So last Tuesday, I went \.\footnote{To meet him and bring him to our village.}

12. And on Saturday, Mehle's father \footnote{Villagers are frequently referred to by their children's names, a practice} went and saw him off again.

13. So I've heard that we paid out ten baht for the expenses we had to help him
with.

14. That's right, isn't it, ten baht?

Somebody 15. Yes.

Headman 16. We spent ten baht. \footnote{At this time (mid-1960s) a baht was worth about 5 cents (20 baht to the dollar).}

17. So what shall we do about that money?

18. We ought to think about the question of this money, all the members of the
committee. \footnote{A committe to handle important matters in Christian villages, of which the}

19. And our whole community, all of us, ought to listen to each other's opinions
and think this over.

20. And I still have \{other things/ more\} to tell you, brethren.

21. Soon, when church is over, \footnote{\textbf{cɔ̂-yɛ̀ yàʔ pə̀ tê yân thâ}: lit. ``when [we've] finished} if we have things to discuss in the committee
room. We can discuss them in the committee room.

22. If there's nothing to discuss in the committee room, soon when church is over
everybody please gather at my house for a while, OK?

23. There are matters I'd like to discuss. Let's consider them. There are several
matters.

24. Brethren, please don't think ``[I] don't want to go, since today is Sunday
and I don't want to do a bad thing.'' \footnote{By breaking the Sabbath.}

25. If you're doing something good, it's good to do it even on Sunday.

26. In fact, if it wasn't today, if today wasn't Sunday, we wouldn't be seeing
each other at all, would we!

27. Since we're so busy, everybody is off to his own place, his own field, his
own mountain.

28. Unless it's Saturday or Sunday, we don't get to see each other at all.

29. Dor that reason if there are people who \{don't/ won't\} come, everybody tell
them to!

30. You really must come \footnote{\textbf{mâ là ve mâ phɛ̀ʔ}: lit. ``cannot not come.''}, brethren, every house [in the village].

31. Unless somebody is \{really/actually\} sick.
