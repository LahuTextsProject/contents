86 Headman's Communication at a Meeting in Church

Cà-bí (Huey Tat)

\. You women who have come, if there are people\footnote{I.e., your menfolk.} in your house, if there are
people who haven't come, please tell all of them about it, OK?

\. Among all of use \footnote{\textbf{nɔ̀-ŋà}꞊\textbf{hɨ}: lit ``you and me''. This is the way to} who make up this community, we're always overloaded with
all kinds of work, aren't we.

\. All the men, all the women, we always have work loaded upon us.

\. All kinds [of work].

\. These days when we're all so busy [with other things], even though there is
work to be done in the village, you brethren haven't had a chance to know about
it, right?

\. But now I'm going to tell you brethren [about it].

\. A while ago a preacher \footnote{This was a Karen pastor from a distant village.} was coming to visit us, so we were told ``Go and
welcome him.''

\. We had heard about this in advance, you see.

\. We were to go and welcome him.

1\. We \{were supposed to/had\} to help him with all of his things.

1\. So last Tuesday, I went \footnote{To meet him and bring him to our village.}.

1\. And on Saturday, Mehle's father \footnote{Villagers are frequently referred to by their children's names, a practice} went and saw him off again.

1\. So I've heard that we paid out ten baht for the expenses we had to help him
with.

1\. That's right, isn't it, ten baht?

Somebody 1\. Yes.

Headman 1\. We spent ten baht. \footnote{At this time (mid-1960s) a baht was worth about 5 cents (20 baht to the dollar).}

1\. So what shall we do about that money?

1\. We ought to think about the question of this money, all the members of the
committee. \footnote{A committe to handle important matters in Christian villages, of which the}

1\. And our whole community, all of us, ought to listen to each other's opinions
and think this over.

2\. And I still have \{other things/ more\} to tell you, brethren.

2\. Soon, when church is over, \footnote{\textbf{cɔ̂-yɛ̀ yàʔ pə̀ tê yân thâ}: lit. ``when [we've] finished} if we have things to discuss in the committee
room. We can discuss them in the committee room.

2\. If there's nothing to discuss in the committee room, soon when church is over
everybody please gather at my house for a while, OK?

2\. There are matters I'd like to discuss. Let's consider them. There are several
matters.

2\. Brethren, please don't think ``[I] don't want to go, since today is Sunday
and I don't want to do a bad thing.'' \footnote{By breaking the Sabbath.}

2\. If you're doing something good, it's good to do it even on Sunday.

2\. In fact, if it wasn't today, if today wasn't Sunday, we wouldn't be seeing
each other at all, would we!

2\. Since we're so busy, everybody is off to his own place, his own field, his
own mountain.

2\. Unless it's Saturday or Sunday, we don't get to see each other at all.

2\. Dor that reason if there are people who \{don't/ won't\} come, everybody tell
them to!

3\. You really must come \footnote{\textbf{mâ là ve mâ phɛ̀ʔ}: lit. ``cannot not come.''}, brethren, every house [in the village].

3\. Unless somebody is \{really/actually\} sick.
