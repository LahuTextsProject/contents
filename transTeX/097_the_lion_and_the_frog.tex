1. Once upon a time there was a certain country.

2. In this country there was a great forest.

3. In this great forest there was an abundance of all beasts and animals.

4. Above all these there was one animal called the lion who was the greatest by
far.

5. Well, one day the lion was roaming around in that country.

6. Wandering around and around he said, "In this country there is no one
who is greater or higher than I am! There is no one who can overcome me--not a
single person!", so he said.

7. When a frog heard him saying this, the frog said, "What are you wandering
around for?"

8. When the lion heard this he thought, "Well, here I am so great and
I'm talked to like that!"

9. And he got very angry.

10. Since he was so angry he went to see who had addressed him thus.

11. When he went to look, there was a big lake.

12. In it there was growing a water lily.

13. Although somebody was talking to him, the lion could not find him.

14. When he had gotten near, the frog said again, "What are you walking
around like that for?"

15. Then the lion became truly furious.

16. He rushed violently forward.

17. When he got to the place, there was a frog sitting on top of a lotus leaf and
talking to him.

18. When the lion tried to bite him, all of a sudden he stumbled into the water.

19. There he roared with all his might, with all his might he bellowed, so his
heart burst and he died.
