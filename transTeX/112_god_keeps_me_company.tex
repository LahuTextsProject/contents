{\textbf{\#112 God Keeps Me Company }}

{1. On this occasion I'd like to sing a little song for my beloved brethren.
}

{Please listen.}

{[Sings]}

{2. amid the sadness of my heart}

{3. when I roam sad at heart}

{4. when I have no friend to share my wandering}

{5. while I am in this state}

{6. when calmly and all alone}

{7. until night falls I keep singing}

{8. my Lord, I walk with my Lord}

{9. I speak to Him, His love, I sing of His love}

{10. while I am in this state, when I happily sing}

{11. He will grant me a song of love}

{12. That's the end.}
