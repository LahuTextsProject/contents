112 God Keeps Me Company (Religious song)

\. On this occasion I'd like to sing a little song for my beloved brethren. Please
listen.

[Sings]

\. amid the sadness of my heart

\. when I roam sad at heart

\. when I have no friend to share my wandering

\. while I am in this state

\. when quiet and all alone

\. until night falls I keep singing

\. my Lord, I walk with my Lord

\. I speak to Him, His love, I sing of His love

1\. while I am in this state, when I happily sing

1\. He will grant me a song of love

1\. That's the end.
