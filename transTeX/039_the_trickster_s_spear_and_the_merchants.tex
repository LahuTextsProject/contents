39 The Trickster's Spear and the Merchants

1. Well, then, there was still another Trickster. \footnote{I.e., ``here's another Trickster story.'' The trickster is here referred to}

2. He put down a packet of rice on the lower part of a road.

3. On the upper part of the road he put a packet of curry. \footnote{ɔ̄-chî (lit. ``rice-enhancer, -elevator''): that which is eaten with rice,}

4. When he was ambling along carrying a spear, a band of traders came along, and
[he said to them]:

5. ``Hey you guys, don't do any [other] trading now!\footnote{Instead of the usual negative imperative adverb \textbf{mâ}, Trickster here}

6. Just trade me your things! And I'll give you this spear.

7. I trade this spear of mine for your [stuff].

8. This spear of mine has magic powers!

9. If you stick it down to the lower part of the road, you get rice to eat.

10. If you stick it down into the upper part of the road, you get meat to eat,''
he said---

11. So then those traders said \{``Let's check it out!''/``Try doing it!''\}, and
when they did it, when they stuck it into [the earth on] the lower part of the
road, they got a packet of rice.

12. When they stuck it into the upper part of the road, they got a packet of chicken.

13. So then they were \{ecstatic/very happy\}, and they thought, ``It's true!''
and after the Orphan had \{obtained/gotten\} their horses [in exchange], when that
band of traders got hungry at noontime, they thrust that spear down into the lower
part of the road, but they didn't get anything.

14. When they thrust it into the upper part of the road they got nothing.

15. So when this happened they wept and went back home.
