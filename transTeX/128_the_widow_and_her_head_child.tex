128 The Widow and her Head-Child

\. Once upon a time there was a widow.

\. One day when this widow had gone to cut thatch-grass, she got terribly thirsty
and looked around for water, but couldn't find any.

\. Then she scooped up and drunk the water that \{was there/ had been left\} in
an elephant's footprint in an old abandoned field, and returned home.

\. Then not long afterwards she became pregnant, and gave birth to a \{son/ child\}.

\. This child had no body, but only a head---just a normal head.\footnote{\textbf{ó-qō cɛ tí, ó-qō-šī cɛ tí}:}

\. But the mother took care of \{him/ it\} properly, and after a fair amount of
time had passed, one day when it was time to cultivate her field, she was going
off to clear the undergrowth.\footnote{\textbf{hɛ phɔ̂ ve }(OV) `clear away undergrowth from a swidden with a heavy}

7a. The head-child said, ``Mother, don't you do the cleaning. Let me do it,'' he
said to his mother, and

7b. The mother burst out, \footnote{``burst out'' translates the emphatic particle \textbf{qha }after \textbf{qɔ̂ʔ} ``I \{doubt/ don't think you\} could do it!'' she
said, and

7c. The head child replied, ``I can do it. Just leave me here and go back.

7d. ``Pretty soon when it's getting dark come and carry me back,'' he said, and

7e. The mother for her part \{did as/ listened to what\} he said, and left him
there.

\. When it got dark and the mother came back to \{see [what had happened]/ find
him\}, she saw that all the clearing of the undergrowth had already been done for
her.

9a. In the same way, [] when the time came for felling the large trees [] in the
swidden, he said to his mother ``I \{know how to/ can\} clearcut the field,'' and
after he said that, his mother went and carried him to the field and left him there,
and she [later] found that the field had been completely clearcut.

1\. And then one day that country was about to be \{invaded/ attacked\} [] by others,
and \{people\}\{predicted/ foretold\}[] that those others would win.

11a. Then he [the Head] said, ``If you just let me fight all by myself, I'll win.''

11b. And when he said that, the Kind said, ``If you fight and win, I have six daughters.

11c. ``Whichever one you want to marry, you may marry, and also I can give you
about one half of my \{country/ kingdom\},'' said the King.

1\. Thereupon the Head-child went to fight, and conquered everything, and he [the
King] gave him [his/ a] daughter and [one half of] the country.

1\. Then one day, after the Head-child had gone [] to market, the \{old lady/ mother-in-law\}
[] was tidying up the house, and accidentally \{set fire to/ burnt up\} the \{place
where the Head would \{live/ be put\}/ Head's living-place\}, and when the Head-child
got back from the market he no longer had a place to hide, and turned into a very
handsome \{person/ man\}
