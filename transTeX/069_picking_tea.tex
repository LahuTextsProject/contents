\textbf{69 Picking Tea}

[Tape VI, Side 2]

\. Càbo: Well, let's talk a little bit about picking tea.  A-kí, have you tried
your hand at picking tea yet this year?

\. A-kí: Well, I've only managed to go picking one day so far.  Since I'm so busy
hoeing my rice-field.  But my tea \textit{is} \{doing fine/flourishing\}[1]!  I
just haven't managed to pick it yet.  I'll just finish hoeing my field first.

\. Càbo: So how is it, Thû-yì? Have you done any tea-picking yet?

\. Thû-Yì: Oh, I've picked two days already.

\. Càbo: Is it good and thick?[2]

\. TY: Well, a little bit of it is doing nicely.  Some of it has gotten rough[3]
though.

\. Càbo: Oh, then have you already tried carrying it down to sell at the tea-market[4]
``place where you sell tea''?  Way over there [at the tea-factory].

\. Thúyì: I've already tried going there.

\. Càbo: This year how much do they say you get for one kilo?

1\. Thúyì: They say about a baht and a half.

1\. CB: A baht and a half.  Wow, last year we only got 20 satang.[5]  This year
we get a baht and a half!

1\. TY Those were the leaves, now it's [we're talking about] the shoots.[6]

1\. CB: This year you're going to pick the shoots too, are you!  You know [ôo],
when you do something like plucking the shoots the plant nearly dies!

1\. TY: They told us to do that.  [``What they said was, do it this way'']  Pick
the shoots this year, then next year, you get to pick the leaves again.[7]

1\. CB: Next year you pick the leaves again, they say.

1\. TY: Yeah.

1\. CB: Well, well!  That's all right, all right then, in that case!  Pā-ɛ́,
this year how many kilo did you get when you picked tea?[8]

1\. Pa-eh: Only five kilo.

1\. CB: Only five kilo.  What happened, the tea wasn't growing thick, in your orchard?

20 [Whisper]: Because he's lazy!

2\. CB: Because he's lazy.  Alas, that's how it goes with lazy people.  They can't
earn a proper living/food to eat.

2\. Pa-eh: Because Thûyì keeps telling me to go visit Thai girls---because that's
all \textit{he} does/he just keeps visiting Thai girls.

2\. TY: [We] \textit{have} to go visit Thai girls.  After you work a little---You
just want to see a woman---we don't have wives yet![9]

2\. Somebody: When you say ``don't go,'' they don't listen, those guys.

2\. CB: How many of them are there, those Thai girls?

2\. TY: There's only one, and I've never even gotten to see her kisser! She just
stayed down [in her home] all the time.[10]

2\. CB: She probably didn't want either one of you.

2\. Somebody: They're supposed to be very pretty, the two of them, the prettiest,
they say.

2\. Pa-eh: It's those guys Cà-cɔ́, Cà-g̈âʔ, and Cà-qā.  They went to
them [the Thai girls] without being invited.

3\. TY: If it wasn't for them, it would have been great for us!

3\. CB: Those guys are blushing like girls [ɔ̀-ma-pa qhe ni yò]!

3\. Somebody: Even though they [the girls] said ``Go home!'' they [the suitors]
didn't listen.  When they said ``you ought to be ashamed! [this is really shameful]''
they didn't listen, so...

3\. Pa-eh: [imitating girl's voice] ``I didn't invite you!  And yet you came.''

3\. CB: Oh, here we are, picking tea. and you act this way.  You'll never earn
a living that way!

3\. Cà-cɔ́: It's like these guys are just squirting water at each other!

3\. CB: Maybe it's because the weather's hot they just keep fooling around, playing
around.

3\. Pa-eh: The fact is, young men are happy, and---

3\. Somebody: It's actually very good, what the two of them have been saying.
If one of them doesn't get the Thai girl, the other one will, they're saying.

3\. TY: If they [the other group of suitors] hadn't come, I bet everything would
have been fine for the two of us.[11]

4\. Pa-eh: It would have been fine.

4\. Jesus Christ [pòthôo, For crying out loud], when you tend your fields and
pick your tea this way, there's no way you're going to come up in the world.[12]
When people teach you, you ignore what they say, for two years now!  You've been
acting this way, both of you...And have you finished hoeing your swiddens [upland
fields]?

4\. Pa-eh: I haven't finished, haven't finished---my field either.

4\. TY: Well, as for having my fields, as far I've only finished one \textit{tû}[13]
and 20 \textit{rai}.

4\. CB: Only one \textit{tû} and 20 \textit{rai}.

4\. TY: Yeah.

4\. So you got [about] two \textit{tû }from your field!  Hey, Cà-mÁ,[14] when
will your father and you do the picking, of your tea?

4\. Cà-mÁ: Well, mine, I guess I can't manage to pick yet.  I have to finish
holing my swidden first.

4\. CB: After you finish hoeing you'll have at the picking.

4\. Cà-mÁ: This field [I mine] I've been thinking I'll probably have to hoe for
two weeks.  Two weeks and five days.

4\. CB: Two weeks and five days.

4\. Cà-mÁ: Yeah, two weeks and five days.  After I've finished hoeing I'll go
picking, until I've finished the job.[15]  I haven't dug [the necessary holes]
for planting my tea-orchard garden yet.[16]

5\. Somebody: It'll all be dried up by that time!

5\. CB: That's what I thought too!  Mine also I haven't gotten to try picking yet,
that tea.  But still, more that not being able to pick the tea, in my opinion this
is what I think: more than having tea or not having tea, I think not having rice
is a cause for anxiety, so [only] after finishing hoeing the [rice] field do I
intend to pick [the tea].

5\. Cà-mÁ: Mine [my rice field] I still have to hoe for a month and a half ``fifteen
days''.  Once I've finished hoeing I also plan to pick.

5\. Somebody: By that time yours will be all rough.

5\. Somebody else: And tell him that he still hasn't even cleared the land for
his tea garden.

5\. CB: Speaking of his tea-garden, it's kept in a densely overgrown state [he
leaves it all overgrown with weeds]

5\. Somebody: It's because you're lazy, all you guys.

5\. Somebody else: If \textit{he}[17] sees it, it will never do, it will never
do.

5\. CB: Maybe even [mâ šī ɛ̀ ``I don't even know''] when he sees it, he'll
take it back from you.  There's also another guy,18 Cà-qɛ́,\textit{ }like that,
not taking care of his tea-garden!

5\. TY [playing role of Cà-qɛ́]: Well, I've had a good talk with the Boss, about
this.

6\. CB: What did he say to you then?

6\. Cà-qɛ́: What he said was, when you have free time for [this] work, just
carefully slash away the undergrowth[18] and then do the picking.  If you don't
do this [slash the undergrowth], the tea won't be any good, he said.

6\. CB: Did he tell you that the shoots would get all shriveled up?

6\. Cà-qɛ́: Yep, he did.

6\. CB: Hmm.

6\. TY: When I finish the work...

6\. CBL Hey, Cà-lɔ̂, Headman,[19] what about you---haven't you picked your tea
already this year yourself?

6\. Headman: Oh, I'm a great tea-picker, you know![20]

6\. CB: As for your picking, you keep saying ``I'll pick, I'll pick!'', but I don't
see that any tea has come [from you]!

6\. Headman: I'm not free yet...

7\. CB: You're only saying that with your mouth! Whatever your do [it's like that]...Anyhow,
maybe it's because you're lazy, isn't it!

7\. Cà-qɛ́: Yes, A while ago for once he did pick.

7\. Headman: ...Wherever I have picked it's nice and cleared off![21]

7\. Cà-qɛ́: Oh, as for the headman, he hasn't done it [any tea-picking]!  Last
year he once picked with me, and he did pick very well.  [But] this year, one has
to say that he hasn't been so diligent, the headman.

7\. Headman: It's just as I said[22].  In the places where I've picked, the bottoms
of the tea-plants are beautiful [là꞊khɨ́ pɨ́].

7\. Cà-qɛ́: He does it well!  That guy, if he's free of [other] work and manages
to do it.  But I haven't seen him do it yet, as of now.

7\. Somebody: So he's good at it---but he doesn't manage to pick much of it!  If
it's just that he's not good at it...[23]

7\. Somebody: As for getting it, he's not capable of getting very much, not like
us, when it comes to tea-picking, that guy.[24]

7\. Somebody: Because he's so good at it!

7\. CB: Other people---I've heard that others have gotten five or six kilos, while
he just got a kilo and a half, for heaven's sake!

8\. Since he's all duded up, he can't pick tea properly!

8\. Somebody else: In order to be able to live on it for a long time you've got
to take care of [one's crop] very well!  Your (pl.) sprouts are starting to bend
and get knocked over[25] when they're only one span high.  This whole year they
won't sprout again!  They'll all dry up!

8\. It's just that they're trying to get a lot, by doing it that way.

8\. CB: Wow, Yâ-pā-ɛ́\textit{ }breaks off each individual sapling into two
sections and puts them in [the ground].  You're lucky the Boss didn't see you![26]

8\. TY: Well, that's just the way we have to do it!

8\. Pā-ɛ́: The reason is, we do it to get a better crop.[27]  As for mine,
the tea plants haven't died at all!  The ones that I picked---

8\. Somebody: There are lots of people---

8\. Pā-ɛ́: We make [break] each sapling into two sections.

8\. Somebody: Don't tell me they didn't die!  They did!---

8\. TY: Anyway, we really ought to pick it fast!  Otherwise the Boss might take
[the tree-plantations] back some day.

9\. CB: Both of you [Pā-ɛ́ \& Thû-yì] are young men, so you should concentrate
your minds28, and if you do the work [necessary] to earn a living, if you can settle
down and do that, you'll get plenty to eat, you two.

91a. TY: Well, you---

91b. Pā-ɛ́: The likes of the two of them are really good at it.

9\. CB: They tell me [you've been running around after] Thai girls, eh? ground
squirrels, eh? and striped squirrels, eh? Taking your gun and hiding wherever you
find a shady place---you'll never make a living that way![28]  When people teach
you, listen to what they say, these people!  [You're] so\{stubborn/thick-skulled\}[29],
[you're] hard to get through to---I've never seen the like.[30]

9\. TY: Well, what do you teach I listen to, I want to listen to.  Please try teaching
me properly!

9\. CB: I just teach the best [``This is all I can teach''] I can, to the people.
And you add the word ``properly!''

9\. TY: Other people [i.e., \textit{we} (Y and Pā-ɛ́)], who \{aren't married/don't
have a wife\}, can't [act] the way you do.

9\. CB: Well, how much have you usually gotten each year then, when you've finished
picking?  From your garden, Yâ-pā-ɛ́?

9\. Yâ-pā-ɛ́: Well, I---

9\. CB: I [qhe] mean, what you pick in the course of one year.

9\. Pā-ɛ́: I myself, what I pick in one year---

10\. TY: Is it more than a hundred?[31]

10\. Pā-ɛ́: It wasn't just [``didn't stay at''] ``more than a hundred''!  It
was about 300![32]

10\. CB: Is it 300 then?!  So, it's about 300[33], you say, in one year, from his.
Well then, A-kí, about how many hundred have you usually gotten in one year,
from yours?

10\. A-kí: Well as for me, I'm not able to pick everything [I've got]!  Since
\{I'm all alone/I have to do it all by myself\}, every year my tea goes rough [34].
I don't have a lot of people.  But anyway, it one year I just get about 150 kilo!
As for tea, it's there.  I [just] can't pick it [all].

10\. CB: Hmm-

10\. A-kí: I have a lot of work, it's not just this [tea-picking] that I have
to do.

10\. CB: Yes indeed.  That's the way it goes.  We hillfolk cultivate mountain fields[35]
for a living, since we don't have [irrigated] paddy-fields or hó-nâ[36].

10\. A-kí: As for that, if we keep fussing with our tea, we won't have enough
to eat!  When we're free [of other work], once in a while we just try to earn some
pocket-money [``seek to use money''][37].

10\. CB: Yes. Well then, Headman, didn't you say that you were going to go ask
for labor[38] to [help you] cultivate?  This year?

10\. Headman: Well, I am trying to ask [``go and ask''] for help.  From among you
guys, my relatives---

11\. CB: If you are going to ask for help, that's very fine!  No matter how many
people come from each household [respond to your request]---whether it's two people
or three people.

11\. TY: Nobody will come!  Don't go asking them, don't go asking them!

11\. Headman: Since I won't be giving them any wages, whether I ask for help or
not \{is my business/depends on me\}.  If I ask them and they don't come, other
[šu][39] people will be told, and when these others [they] hear that they didn't
come, it will be their fault [šu àʔ cɔ̀ ve yò][40]

11\. CB: Yes.  Do try asking! Even if one person doesn't come, another person will---that's
the way people are.[41]  What day are you planning to go ask for help?

11\. Headman: I'm planning to go and try asking on Wednesday.[42]

11\. CB: On Wednesday.  Please don't do it on Wednesday.  It's [too] hard to carry
the hoes back.[43]  If you do it after the weekend, do it on Monday.  As long as
people have carried the hoes back on Saturday.

11\. Headman: Well, then, I'll do it on Tuesday!

11\. CB: Mm-hm.  If you do it on Tuesday, that'll be fine.

11\. Headman: [giving the reason he wants to do it Tues. instead of Mon.] For one
day I just [have/ want to] do to my [field/ swidden] and pick up [my tools] and
carry them back.  After doing a few licks of work in the swidden too.

11\. CB: I've heard that you [guys] now get one and a half baht [per kilo] per
person for picking tea.[44]  As for me, I would only get 25 satang, [that's what]
they [gave] me.  Even for one kilo.

12\. Headman: Wow.

12\. TY: It's because you're [i.e., Cà-bo] no good at picking!  Because you're
not like other people.

12\. CB: That's not so!  If you look at what I pick, it's the same [as others].

12\. Headman: I don't think it's like that [i.e., that they discriminate in pay
according to who the picker is].  That it's ``each person a different kind''[45].

124 CB: Maybe they \textit{do} discriminate.[46]  They may like/favor one person
and hate another one.

12\. Pā-é: If you don't agree on the terms carefully [``don't talk with each
other''], that's what happens.

12\. Headman: Well, I'm going to discuss this carefully again.

12\. CB: You relatives, if you're friendly with him [the Boss][47], you just ought
to help me speak.

12\. TY: It's probably because you're not acquainted with each other.[48]

12\. CB: No, we're not acquainted [šī dàʔ], me anyway.

13\. TY: Well, we all are acquainted with him.

13\. CB: Hmm---
