The files in this directory support the production of Jim's

Window to a Vanished World:
Preservation and Analysis of Lahu Texts from the 1960's

This is a provisional title, of course!

To make the PDF, set up the environment:

XeLaTeX, aka TeXLive
SIL Charis

Then type:

    ./makeLahuTexts.sh 4testLahuTexts.xml

in a terminal window.

(all the work occurs in the /tex directory, the contents of 
which can be removed, and should certainly not be check in to svn!)

There is a "transducer testing" script, invoked as follows:

   python test.py

which reads the file named "lahu_writing.txt" and output the results of
transduction to the console.

or, if you have a "full XML dump" in the "generic XML format", try that.

STEPS TO CREATE THE FULL XML DUMP

1. Select (highlight) Interlinear Text from Text & Words
2. Select Export Interlinear from File menu
3. Select Verifiable generic XML from the list of formats
4. Click Export
5. Select all texts by clicking twice on the No Genre checkbox in the Choose Text dialog, Click OK
6. Enter a filename, e.g. “lahutext20150707.xml”
7. Click Save.

(takes a while … a few minutes)

Other details:

 grep "title" lahutexts.xml | perl -pe 's/^.*?>(.*?)<.*/\1/' > flextitles.txt
 
 (this makes a list of all the titles in the FLEX xml dump)
