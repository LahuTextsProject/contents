The files in this directory support the production of Jim's

Window to a Vanished World:
Preservation and Analysis of Lahu Texts from the 1960's

This is a provisional title, of course!

To make the PDF, set up the environment:

XeLaTeX, aka TeXLive
SIL Charis

Then type:

    ./makeLahuTexts.sh 4testLahuTexts.xml

in a terminal window.

(all the work occurs in the /tex directory, the contents of 
which can be removed, and should certainly not be check in to svn!)

There is a "transducer testing" script, invoked as follows:

   python test.py

which reads the file named "lahu_writing.txt" and output the results of
transduction to the console.

or, if you have a "full XML dump" in the "generic XML format", try that.

Other details:

 grep "title" lahutexts.xml | perl -pe 's/^.*?>(.*?)<.*/\1/' > flextitles.txt
 
 (this makes a list of all the titles in the FLEX xml dump)
