CoRSAL Occasional Publications provides an affordable and accessible
alternative for showcasing scholarsâ€™ analyses of connected
naturalistic text.  CoRSAL Occasional Publications Volume 2 by James
A. Matisoff provides an unprecedented variety of Lahu
language-in-use and a window into a world that few of us could
otherwise witness.  This text collection, especially as complemented
by the audio recordings in CoRSAL, will be of lasting interest to
historical, comparative, and typological linguists, as well as
speakers connecting or reconnecting with cultural and linguistic
traditions.

Audio recordings of the items collection can be found in the
Computational Resources of South Asian Languages archive.
