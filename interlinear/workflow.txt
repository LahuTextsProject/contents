Lahu text workflow:

FLEx:
  Major tasks:
    Interlinearization:
      Type up and interlinearize:
        7 Walker texts (translations need to be typed up too)
          Add hyphens where needed
        About 10 Lahu bilingual humor texts (already translated: ##s 101, 102, 103, 105, 107a, 108, 110)
          Black Lahu / Shan (6)
          Black Lahu / Yellow Lahu (4)
      Interlinearize:
        Complete! (90% as of 10/3)
      Do a second/third pass of interlinearization for all texts
    Lexicon:
      Mark all variation as free, not dialectal
      Move senses to their own/other headwords where appropriate
      Implement correct Lahu collation (Ginny)
      Myriad other tasks
    Grammar:
      Clean up inconsistencies in form class designations?
    Minor issues:
      weird alphabetization (deal with via software? is there a FLEx-internal solution?)

Translations:
  Finish all translations
  Texify â€” can this be automated without grief?
  Polish free translations (Susan can help)
  Review and rework footnotes
  Edit in github, not dropbox!
  Integrate with rest of text
  Create Lahu titles for all texts (Jim)

Software:
  sequencer for texts: genre and then within genre (requires updating Catalog)
  incorporate translations
  revise PDF output to be more compact
  
Catalog:
  Update spreadsheet for genre and sequence with genre
  Update status of text: status of translations, etc.
  
Bibliography:
  Enter all citations, include in deliverables
  
Final Deliverables:
  Interlinear Texts deployed on the web (@ Lacito? On a site by itself?)
  Print version (only JAM's transcription)
  Find a publisher
