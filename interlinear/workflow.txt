Lahu text workflow:

FLEx:
  Major tasks:
    Interlinearization:
      Type up and interlinearize:
        Walker texts (translations need to be typed up too)
        Lahu bilingual humor texts (already translated: ##s 101, 102, 103, 105, 107a, 108, 110)
      Interlinearize:
        127 Founding a new village (text already in FLEx, but needs analyzed)
      Do a second/third pass of interlinearization for all texts
    Lexicon:
      Mark all variation as free, not dialectal
      Move senses to their own/other headwords where appropriate
      Myriad other tasks
    Grammar:
      Clean up inconsistencies in form class designations?
    Minor issues:
      weird alphabetization (deal with via software? is there a FLEx-internal solution?)

Translations:
  Texify â€” can this be automated without grief?
  Edit in github, not dropbox

Software:
  sequencer for texts
