[Tape III, Side 2 #1]\
1: (H) Ahem, well, I have a little announcement\super 1\nosupersub  to make to you, brothers. On Monday morning\super 2\nosupersub  Ja\uc0\u118 \u772 a\u660  and Na\u104 \u772 pui are planning to get married! Now don't any of you go off anyplace!\super 3\nosupersub  We're going to celebrate the wedding, you see. We'll have a feast in joy and gladness, I tell you. \
2: (T) Well, my brothers, getting married--the joining of hands in marriage--is a very important thing according to our Christian customs. Therefore let everyone remain [in the village] in joy and gladness. For this is no laughing matter for us. Since they are to take one another in marriage in the sight of God, we Christians must all observe the occasion\super 4\nosupersub  with the two of them in joy and gladness. \
3: (H) Well, will they slaughter a pig (to eat)?\
4: (T) Well, I daresay they'll have to slaughter a pig, all right. Even in times past--from time immemorial\super 5\nosupersub --there has been a wise saying to the effect that when people get married, if they don't celebrate it with a wedding feast, there will be no luck and no success with the crops [that year], either. \
5: (H) Well, in that case, it ought to be done early in the morning, the whole business of killing the pig.\super 6\nosupersub  \
6: (T) Yes, we ought to do it rather early. According to my plans we'll kill the pig\super 7\nosupersub  at six-thirty, finishing with it at seven, then at eight o' clock we'll join their hands [in marriage]. In the church. Who all will be in the pig-slaughtering party? Make the arrangements properly, each side by \{itself / yourself\}.\super 8\nosupersub \
7: (H) Well, on my side, Ja-ui is one, and Ja-ha is another, and Ja-geh is another. Three people ought to be enough, for my side. \
8: (T) Now on my side, Ja-qa is one, and Eh-kha-paw\super 9\nosupersub  is another, and Ja-qu-nyi is another--with these three people it should be enough, as far as my side goes. \
9: (H) It comes to six people. That's plenty. We have enough then, with that many. \
10: (T) Well, this girl now,\super 10\nosupersub  I don't really know her. Whose child is she anyway?\
11: (H) Oh, don't they say that she's the daughter of Ja-qeh and Na-da\uc0\u660 ?\
12: (T) Ja-qeh and Na-da\uc0\u660 's daughter, eh?\
13: (H) Yep.\
14: (T) Aha, so that's the one. But I doubt if she can take a husband yet! She's not big [enough] yet!\
15: (H) She's big enough, she's big enough now. \
16: (T) How old has she gotten to be, do they say?\
17: (H) She's eight.\
18: (T) Eight! Good grief, if she's only eight, how can she sleep with a man!\
19: (H) [laughing] She's thirteen, thirteen and a half!\super 11\nosupersub \
20: (Boy) I bet you can't get into her yet.\super 12\nosupersub \
21: (H) She's thirteen and a half already.\
22: (T) Thirteen, huh? And how old do they say the man is? \
23: (H) I heard them say the man was twenty-five.\
24: (T) Twenty-five. Wow, a man that strong can't make it with a girl who's only eight! I mean, a girl who's only 
\i thirteen
\i0 .\
25: (H) She's big, I tell you. I'll bet she can. She's big [enough] already. Her frame is a good size.\super 13\nosupersub \
26: (T) I wonder just how big her body is. Her frame, I mean.\
27: (H) It's plenty big, plenty big. (her frame).\
28: (T) The guy is big, you know! Because he's from great stock. \
29: (H) Oh, she's not afraid, they say. Since she's big already.\
30: (Kach) Could anybody make it with her now?\
[laughter]\
31: (H) They say she can, I tell you!\
32: (Boy) I still don't really know who she is.\
33: (H) Na-hpui, Na-hpui! Na-da\uc0\u660 's daughter. \
34: (boy) Oh.\
35: (T) I see. She's a north-country person, isn't she?\
36: (H) Right. A north-country girl, from up there. She lives south of Va-na,\super 14\nosupersub  they say. \
37: (Boy) \{Yes-sirree-Bob! / Ayuh!\}\super 15\nosupersub \
38: Is she a Christian?\
39: (H) I hear she became one not long ago\super 16\nosupersub --she's a Christian.\
40: Has she learned a little about our ways and customs already?\
41: (T) Well then, about the \{man / groom\}--whose son do they say he is?\
42: (H) You mean the groom?\
43: (T) Yes.\
44: (H) Didn't you hear me say he was Ja-qeh's son?\super 17\nosupersub \
45: (T) Ja-qeh's son?\
46: (H) Ja-qeh's son--\
47: (T) I bet they call him Ja-qeh because he's an oddball.\super 18\nosupersub \
48: (H) Exactly. He grows tea with the Thais. He's peculiar. \
49: Yeah. \
50: Because they say he acts like some kind of nut,\super 19\nosupersub  I bet.\
51: He's a nut, all-right-all-right.\
52: He's probably the farmer who--\super 20\nosupersub \
53: (T) He's what you [call] a nut.\
54: He's probably the farmer who went and stole those people's things yesterday to feed his face and who the Thais chased and beat up [with sticks].\
55: (H) Of course. He's the guy they were talking about who stole their elephant-chains at Melhawmaw\super 21\nosupersub --the elephant-ropes and the neck-chains and went and sold them to fill his belly! \
56: (T) Ah, ah, ah, ah.\
57: (Boy) The one who the dogs were chasing to bite!\
58: (T) Now I know, now I know\'85. Well then, the time has now come to join their hands in marriage. Haven't they beat the gong yet?\super 22\nosupersub  Have they beat it already?\
59: (H) They've beaten it, they've beaten it. Let's go, let's go.\
60: (T) You've heard it Everybody hears it.\super 23\nosupersub  I suppose everyone has heard it, eh?\
61: (H) We've heard it.\
62: (T) Ah, now I hear it [too]!\
63: (Boy) I hear it now!\
64: We ought to make it snappy and go.\

\cf0 65: (T) Well, since these two friends of ours' getting married today--this morning--magnifies and elevates the very great laws and ways of God, of all of us have indeed arrived, He\super 24\nosupersub  will join their hands in marriage. At this time, do you, Java?,\super 25\nosupersub  swear in the sight of God and in the sight of all these people that you will not separate or stray\super 26\nosupersub  from this your wife Na-hpui\super 25\nosupersub  as long as you shall live, that you shall not abandon or reject her,\super 27\nosupersub  even should she become crippled or blind, even should she become sick or unwell: that until\super 28\nosupersub  you must be separated by death you will not separate or stray from her, neither abandoning nor rejecting her?\
66: (C\'e0-v\'e0\uc0\u660 ) I swear it. \
67: (T) He swears it. It is well. \
Now then, Na-hpui, [do you swear that] your husband who is now holding your hand--er--\
68: [prompting] Java\uc0\u660 !\
69: (T) --this man 
\i Java\uc0\u660 
\i0 --do you swear in the sight of God and in the sight of all these people that as long as you live, unless God should take you away and cause you to separate from one another, whether he should become ill and diseased, or crippled and blind, or poor and wretched, that you will look after him, and help him, and take care of him, that until you must be separated by death he will be your husband forever? \
70: (Na-ph\uc0\u616 \u770 ) I swear it.\
71: (T) she swears it. It is well. \
Well, then, [now] we just have to divide up the pork! Has the pork been divided yet?\
72: (H) It's [all] cut up and stacked, it's [all] cut up and stacked. Look over there!\
73: (T) Well, how shall we do it?\
74: (H) Shall we \{cook / boil\} it and eat it [all together]? Or shall we divide it up, among the various houses?\
75: (Kach) Divide it, divide it!\
76: (T) Divide it! \
77: (Boy) Divide it!\
78: (T) How shall we do it? Shall we make it one share per couple? Or else shall we make it one share per household?\super 29\nosupersub \
79: Make it one share per household. It's too much trouble [otherwise]. \
80: (H) But look, I have many people [in my house], too or three couples, and if there are lots of them they want a lot to eat!\
81: (T) Even if you do have lots of people, when it's time to work, they don't do it! Only one person [from your house] did any work with this business.\super 30\nosupersub \
82: Right! When it's time to work, only one person does it. \
83: (T) [But] when it's time to eat, they want to eat a lot! That's what [I call] being greedy! \
84: (H) Shouldn't this be what you call "acting out of voluntary charity"?\super 31\nosupersub  If you were being charitable, [everyone] ought to eat!\
85: (T) To receive voluntary charity, one should also do voluntary work! It's never all of us who do the work! \
86: (H) We 
\i do 
\i0 work!--\
87: (T) Only one person from your whole house, 
\i one person
\i0 . And when he does happen to come once in a while, he goes home before noon! When it comes to working. \
88: Would you swear that they don't work?\
89: (T) I would swear to it. I never once saw them working.\
90: (H) Well then, how much pork will we eat, \{all together / in all\}? \
91: (Boy) Don't give those guys anything to eat!\
92: (H) Thirty-five kilos, we'll eat 35 kilos.\
93: (T) Are you setting up a rule\super 32\nosupersub  [that it should be] 35 kilos?\
94: (H) I 
\i am
\i0  making it a rule. Starting from today and in the future everyone will have to observe\super 33\nosupersub  it, and it alone.\
95: (T) If that is the only \{permissible course / way it may be done), I'm afraid\super 34\nosupersub  that only those who are well-off will [even] be able to set up housekeeping. If you're poor--the poor and penniless won't be able to set up housekeeping like them. \
96: (H) As for that, that's something that both sides--the groom's parents and the bride's parents--should agree on. There are people who join hands [in marriage] even without having a wedding-feast\super 35\nosupersub . There are also those who just kill a little chicken\super 36 \nosupersub or two and get married. If your word is good--\super 37\nosupersub \
97: (T) Oh, well in that case it's all right. So, how shall we divide up this pork? If no one objects\super 38\nosupersub , distribute it to the [various] houses, headman--give it out to the houses!\
98: (H) Here, give it out to the houses, to the houses. Give it out to the houses! Try dividing it up so each house gets eight MEH.\super 39\nosupersub  Take it and put it in [the scales]! Spear\super 40\nosupersub  [the meat]!\
99: Spear it, spear it, spear it! \
100: (H) Put it in, into that scale.\
101: (T) Ah, everybody must lend a hand\super 41\nosupersub  in the proper spirit. Otherwise, if we're all arguing and squabbling about it, if they should overhear us, if the others overhear us, it would be very embarrassing. We'd be ashamed in front of them.\
102: (H) Ah, here come the people! Give out the pork. It's already divided up. \
103: (T) Announce\super 42\nosupersub  it, announce it! \
104: Come and get the pork, come and get the pork! It's for the whole blessed village\super 43\nosupersub ! \
105: We're coming to get it, we're coming to get it.\
106: (T) I don't see them coming from over there yet, from Jabuuh's part of the village.\super 44\nosupersub  \
107: (H) Go call them, go call them!\
108: (T) He says to go call Jabuuh's part of the village. \
109: Jabuuh! Come and get your pork, I tell you!\
110: (C\'e0-b\'f9\uc0\u660 ) [lazily] Let me make some tea first.\super 45\nosupersub \
111: (T) There was plenty of time to make tea this morning! You didn't even come to the wedding ceremony.\super 46\nosupersub  People like you are hard to teach to and hard to preach to,\super 47\nosupersub  that's all there is to it! It never fails. \
112: (Boy) He's just smoking his opium\super 48\nosupersub !\
113: (T) He \{has a flat forehead / plays it close to the forehead\super 49\nosupersub \}, you know.\
[laughter]\
114: (C\'e0-b\'f9\uc0\u660 ) Fault-finding bastards! I wouldn't eat anything of yours now anyway!\
115: (T) It's all the same to us if you don't eat! Since we've tried to offer it to you properly.\super 50\nosupersub \
116: Don't eat it then! You're the only one who doesn't get along with the others.\
117: (H) Don't quarrel, don't quarrel. Let's do this charity, let's do this charity, gaining grace and gaining blessings.\
118: (T) The Sexton's part of the village hasn't come yet either, strange to say!\super 51\nosupersub  Carrying on this way, you people are hard to reason with. Even when we say "Come and eat!" you still don't come. \
119: (H) Look up there, look up there, I see his son coming, look up there! Give it to him. Give him a \{bundle / spearing\} [of meat]. One bundle. \
120: (T) Give it to him, one bundle.\
121: Here, here, here you are. Tayk\super 51\nosupersub  it away! \
121A: (Boy playingn C\'e0-b\'f9\uc0\u660 's son)__INAUDIBLE__ It's not even as big as my dick. \
122: (H) Well, it's all over then, this wedding-feast. [We've finished] giving out the pork, each house's share. If anybody hasn't come, it's dark out already\super 52\nosupersub \'85. \

129: I'll bet he ran away [from her] because he couldn't stand sleeping with her.\
130: That's probably not true.\
131: Sure. If that wasn't it, he shouldn't have run away.\

Like when a husband and wife say they will get divorced,\super 72\nosupersub  whichever one it is who doesn't want to stay married and [who wants to] cast the other off, he is the one who must pay for it. Our ancestors have had such a rule and such a precept.\super 73\nosupersub \

168: (H?) Well, for our guiding principle let us act according to those which were observed in the days of our ancestors, shall we not, my brothers? According to the practice of our ancestors, whenever anyone didn't want to stay married and cast off [a spouse] he had to [pay] fifteen rupees.\super 78\nosupersub  And in case there were children, it was thirty rupees.\super 79 \nosupersub Tonight you all [should settle] this matter according to the rule observed by our forefathers that "He who abandons [his spouse] must pay for it."\super 80\nosupersub  \

172: (T) If it comes to 150 baht, it's customary [for the headman] to deduct\super 81\nosupersub  15 baht, you know. The "listening-price." Here, you take 135 baht with you. This 15 baht is taken out to cover the "sitting expenses" for all these people--the tea money and the tobacco money.\
173: So here, take it, take it, take it already!\super 82\nosupersub \
174: [chuckling] Since you've paid me my compensation, that's all there is to it. \
175: (T) Well, this business is over and done with. \

37. The Headman leaves the rest of his thought unsaid: "As long as you are a man of your word, any arrangement you might make will be all right."

70. t\'e2\uc0\u660  ve is a Shan borrowing meaning 'to pass sentence.'\
