\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 87 Candid conversation before Building an Airstrip\

\b0 1a: I think this is funny.\
1b: Don't laugh, mother!\
2: I'll be the one who asks. You people will answer. \
3: [About] how the airstrip is coming along--how building the airstrip is coming along.\
4: You people are now making a landing place for airplanes in Shatudeu village--\
5: Don't \{do it / turn it on\} yet [=the tape-recorder]. We'll talk it over among ourselves first.\
Paul \
6: O.K.\
7: We'll talk t over first. Don't do it yet. '[We are] building an airstrip in Shatudeu village.' '[Planes with] how many heads [=engines] do they say will be able to land,' I'll ask you, all right? Then you guys will answer me, right? 'Three-engined ones can land.'\
8 :Say that we're making a landing place for ones with three engines. Think carefully [before you speak]. Remember [what to say] and do it just exactly right! Otherwise it could turn out the way it did before with Jamu's fatherNB--he got stuck and didn't know what to say [Lit: his words were blocked]. (NB. The Lahu are teknonymous.) \
9: One person can say what sort of thing it is that's called an 'airplane.' [Lit: how it goes with an 'airplane']\
Dav 10: Yes, we'll say that over here, then you both should continue talking on that subject. Now this time keep everything in mind, please! [Laughs] In a minute we'll do it [=record]. \
         11: It's going in already! Listen! Into the hearing-machine. [=tape recorder]  \
Dav 12: I don't think it's going in yet. It's not going in yet. They're not doing it yet. \
        13: Turn it on! We'll speak now. \
Paul 14: How you can do [=record] it. \
         15: Can we do it already?\
Dav 16: Just speak the way you planned it out a while ago, O.K.?\
Paul 17: Talk as loud as you can, please.}
