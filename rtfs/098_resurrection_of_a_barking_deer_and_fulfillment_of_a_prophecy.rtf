\f0\b\fs34 \cf0 98 Resurrection of a Barking Deer and Fulfillment of a Prophecy\

\b0 \
[former title "Barking Deer and Swallowed Berries, or He did it after all"]\
\
1. Once upon a time there was a married couple.\
\
2. They were very lazy.\
\
3. They didn\'92t want to work.\
\
4. So day after day they just stayed home.\
\
5. Well, one day came when they were getting hungry.\
\
6. Since they were so hungry, they went off into the woods to dig for yams to eat.\
\
7. While they were off to dig for yams to eat, they found a barking deer [1] that had choked to death on a \
    wild gooseberry! [2]\
\
8. So then the two of them, husband and wife, carried the barking deer back home.\
\
9. So they headed back and arrived home, and put it into a big basket for storing rice, and set some water \
    on the fire to boil.\
\
10. Meanwhile their children were playing around stroking the barking deer.\
\
11. The kids were saying, \'93Are you the one that says 
\b p\'e9
\b0 ? Are you the one that says 
\b p\'ed
\b0 ?\'94, joking and \
      playfully stroking it.\
\
12. Then all of a sudden what was caught in its throat was stroked back into its stomach, and it jumped up\
      and ran away.\
\
13. So then this couple went to a fortune-teller [3] to ask a question.\
\
14. He said to the fortune-teller, \'93Oh, master, will I be able to get my animal back, or won\'92t I be able to get \
      it back?,\'94 he asked.\
\
15. The fortune-teller said, \'93Ah, that animal of yours you cannot get back.\
\
16. \'93If you try to do so, you will just have to lick your wife\'92s \'91thing\'92.\'94[4]\
\
17. At this he retorted, \'93Oh, you miserable fortune-telling sonofabitch!\'94,
\f1  [5
\f0 ] and chased him away.\
\
18. After this, when they reached a certain point [on their way home], rain came pouring down, and they got drenched and were freezing.\
\
19. When they got back home, the husband and wife both sat down in front of the tripod in the fireplace and warmed themselves by the fire.\
\
20. Then he caught sight of his wife\'92s thing, and stuck a finger right inside,[6] and it disappeared in \
      there. When he took it out it was all wet, so he tried wiping it off on the tripod.\
\
20. When he wiped it off on the tripod, he [his finger] got burned, so he licked it vigorously.\
\
21. Then all of a sudden he remembered.\
\
22. \'93What the fortune-teller told me just now was true!\'94, he realized.\
