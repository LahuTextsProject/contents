5d. Anything and everything, [3] all kinds of things.\
5e. Like, we could pretend to be bachelors [4]: \'93I wonder if we should go down 					there to pitch a little woo\'94 [5], \'93If we go down there there\'92s not going to be any 					place to flirt,\'94 one guy can say, and the other one can say, \'93Over there you\'92ve 					got to wait! You\'92d have to stay down there a long time.\'94\
6. CL: Tell a little bit about the Kachin [6] looking for a wife!  Why is he looking for one, I wonder?\
      			<Woman laughs>\
7a. H: I hear the Jingpho is coming back from looking for a wife. [7]\
7b. You [8] stay at home and pound lots of rice and store it, and when he gets back you can eat \
            it  up\'97say something like that.\
8. CL: Will he get one, or won\'92t he\'97think about that, and talk nicely about it!\
9a. H: Hey, hurry up and do it, hurry up, you guys! About everything\'97\
9b. Well then, I\'92m going to roll me up one of those great big Kl\'e8t-Thawng [9] cigars like you\'92ve seen\

                    it! [13]\

15c. Say \'93She\'92s hiding all your shoulderbags!\'94\

16. CL: Is that what goes on when the young women and young men [15] court each other? They \
              hide things from each other?\
17. H: They hide things from each other. They take things and hide them. They hide towels from \
              each other.\
18. CL: They don\'92t return them, do they, the things that they\'92ve hidden?\
19. H: They don\'92t give them back. They buy very good gold rings to hand over [16] [to their betrothed].\
20. CL: Uh-huh.\
21. H: The girls\'92 things they hand over to us, and our things we hand over to them. Later on they \
              have  discussions about getting married.\
22a. HW: Hurry up and record, they say. They say they\'92re going to take pictures.\
22b. The next time they come, they\'92ll give them to us, they say.\
23. CL: Hurry up and do it. Can\'92t you do it?\
24a. H: Come and go at it, come and go at it, you guys!\

27. CL: No need to be bashful! Just do it any old way\'97\
28. Boy: Stop it! [21]\

\i0\b0 Well, put in everything about the cocks crowing when women give birth!\
31. Somebody: Let a woman do that then!\
32. H: Put in how people long ago, how the Chinese for no reason at all drove us Lahu along \
             by force [22], how we fled down below that high plateau, and how afterwards we then \
             stayed down there in the valley where they attacked us again\'97how year after year we \
             were exhausted [by all that].\
33. CL: Yes, do it just like that!\
34. H: Let us hear about how when we\'92re clear-cutting a swidden and a branch breaks off a \
              tree and knocks somebody over \'97\
That\'92s happened to everybody.\
C\'e0-q
\f2 \uc0\u97 \u772 
\f0 , come sit here! Come

36. H: Oh this bunch of kids are "going
\b pu-l\'ee-kh
\f1 \uc0\u596 \u770 
\f0 -l\'ee
\b0 " [25], so probably none of them will come up \
             with an idea.\

\f1 \uc0\u596 \u770

39. CL: Yeah.\
40a. H: <making grotesque gestures> When your shins are like this, and your head, your face\'97like \
              this\'97that\'92s what we mean by 
\b pu-l\'ee-kh
\f1 \uc0\u596 \u770 
\f0 -l\'ee
\b0  in Lahu.\

40b.
\b Pu-l\'ee-kh
\f1 \uc0\u596 \u770 
\f0 -l\'ee
\b0  means \'93all bulging and pursed\'94\'97a pursed mouth\'97\

\f1 \uc0\u660 
\f0 : You ask me things and I\'92ll answer you back\'97\'91Today where did you go?,\'92 \
                   \'91I went there\'92, \'91I went here\'92\'97\
42. CL: Yes, that\'92s great, great!\

\f2 \uc0\u103 \u776 
\f0 \'e2
\f1 \uc0\u660 
\f0 : Is it already turned on? Has it been going like this the whole time? Can [our voices] enter \
                    it already?\
45a. CL: Let this [tape] finish first. Then we\'92d like to put in a new one.\
45b. [To me, in English] Do you want to start another one?\
46. JAM: [In English] Ask them if they want to hear what they just said.\
				* * *\
47. CL: Wait a second.  I\'92ll just put in a new one.\
48. H: What\'92ll we do? Hunting? We\'92ve already recorded about hunting. Shall we do \
             \'93hunting  squirrels,\'94[26] C\'e0-
\f2 \uc0\u103 \u776 
\f0 \'e2
\f1 \uc0\u660 
\f0 ?\
49a. CL: Let\'92s also do it about fighting wars!\
       49b. You\'92ve fought alongside 
\f2 [27
\f0 ] the Chinese, haven\'92t you?\
       49c. Like that time when we were fighting with Japan.\
       49d. Can\'92t you [talk about] the Japanese coming up [to Shan State] and the Thais coming up there, \
               and their fighting each other?\
       49e. The white men chased them out, and the Japanese fled, you can say.\
       49f. If it hadn\'92t been for so many airplanes coming like that\'97\
50. H: <talking to the boys playing the guitar>\
        You tap on the upper part like this, there on the upper part [of the neck of the guitar] you press \
        upwards [i.e., higher up on the strings] or you press downwards.\
51a. CL: Yeah, like this?\
       51b. The thing is you have to use all five [fingers], five of them.\
       51c. If you can do this you can earn a lot of money.\
       51d. People who do this in White Man\'92s country, in one night they get a thousand...  [28]]\
