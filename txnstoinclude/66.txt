66. Candid Conversation: Working up to being recorded

Cà-l__: 1. Hurry up and do it!
Headman's wife [HW]: 2. I'll bring my dog and have him {do it/ record} for you!
Somebody: 3. Bring your god and come put him down here [1] for us!
HW: 4. The dogs are right outside, a big pack of them.
***
Headman [H]: 5a. Come on, come on you guys have nothing to be bashful about!
5b. They [2] say they want to get stuff
5c. When it's time for him to go back to America—our Lahu way of life.
5d. Anything and everything, [3] {this and that/ all kinds of things}.
5e. Like, we could {pretend to be/ "do"} bachelors [4]: "I wonder if we should go down there to 
pitch a little woo" [5]—"If we go down there there's not going to be {anyplace/ any chance} to 
court," one guy can say, and the other one can say, "Over there you've got to wait! You'd have 
to stay down there a long time."
Cà-l__: 6. Tell a little bit about the Kachin [6] looking for a wife!  Why's he looking for one, I 
wonder.
<Woman laughs>
H: 7a. [addressing someone presumably living in the Jingpho's house while he is on his quest] I 
hear the Jingpho is coming back from looking for a wife.
7b. You stay at home and pound lots of rice and store it, and when he gets back you can eat it 
up—say something like that.
Cà-l__: 8. Will he get one, or won't he—think about that, and talk nicely about it!
H: 9a. Hey, hurry up and do it, hurry up, you guys! About everything—
9b. Oh, oh, I'm going to roll me one of those great big Klèt-Thawng [7] cigars like you've seen 
the idiots smoke—
9c. In the old days in Shan State we used to smoke great big cigars that would fill your mouth 
right up!
Cà-l__ [henceforth CL]: 10. Were they what was called _ê-pyîn-lei_ [8]? Or were they [the 
cheroots] called _ê-p__-lei_?[9]
H: 11. Cigars—big cigars. Now I'm going to roll me a big one!
CL: 12. Go to it!
Woman: They're doing it, I tell you! It's already turned on [10]! Hurry up and {put something in 
it! (i.e., record stuff)}!
Kid: 14. Great big Klèt-Thawng cigars.
H: 15a. Hmm. Come on, hurry up and come do it! About all kinds of stuff.
15b. Everything about courting the girls—say "That girl is waiting for you there!"
15c. Say "She's hiding [11] all your shoulderbags!"
15d. Say "She's hiding your {handkerchiefs/ towels} [12]"!
CL: 16. Is that what {goes on/ happens} when the {young women and young men/ young man 
and woman} [13] court each other? They hide things from each other?
H: 17. They hide things from each other. They take things and hide them. They hide {towels/ 
handkerchiefs} from each other.
CL: 18. They don't return them, do they, the things that they've hidden?
H: 19. They don't give them back. They buy very good gold rings to hand over [14] [to their 
betrothed].
CL: 20. Uh-huh.
H: 21. The girls' things they hand over to us, and our things we hand over to them. Later on they 
have discussions about getting married.
HW: 22a. Hurry up and record, they say. They say they're going to take pictures.
22b. The next time they come, they'll give them to us, they say.
CL: 23. Hurry up and do it. Can't you do it?
24a. Come and go at it, come and go at it, you guys!
24b. You could even talk Karen! [15]
24c. Hey, Cà-g_â_, why don't you record something in Karen-Shmaren[16]!
CL: 25. You can ask things like "How old are you?", right?
H: 26a. Hey, Cà-g_â_, let's do it in Thai.[17]
26b. Sit down here! We'll talk White Man's language [18]!
<laughter>
CL: 27. No need to be bashful! Just do it any old way—
Boy: 28. Stop it! [19]
CL: 29. It's like playing.
H: 30a. <sings> Mmm—sol do la sol do la sol mi do mi re do re mi re sol la sol mi do sol la do ti 
la sol [will have to listen to the tape to get the rhythm]
Somebody: 31. Let {the women/ a woman} do that then!
H: 32. Put in how just like people [did to us] long ago, the Chinese drove us along by force [20], 
and how we fled down {south of/ below} that high plateau, and how we then stayed down there 
in the valley where they {attacked/ chased} us again—how year after year we were exhausted.
CL: 33. Yes, do it like that!
H: 34a. Let us hear about how when we're clear-cutting a swidden [21] and a branch breaks off a 
tree and {crushes somebody/ knocks somebody over}—
34b. That's happened to everybody.
34c. Cà-qa_, come sit here! Stick yourself in here!
34d. For ten liters of hulled rice figure out how many baht they ought to pay and sell it to them 
for that much—say that!
34e.—these kids {can't/don't want to} help us—
<The young men keep fiddling with the guitar that JAM brought as a gift.>
34f. [to the guitar players] Do it right, do it right!
34g. Did you hear, [22] a while ago that was a pretty tune! <sings> la sol mi do do _ [octave 
higher] la do ti la sol.
CL: 35. Hurry up and do it! Don't you have anything to record finally?
H: 36. Oh this bunch of kids are {going pu-lî-kh__-lî/ acting like idiots}[23], so probably more 
of them will come up with an idea.
<laughter>
CL: 37. What does "going pu-lî-kh__-lî" mean?
<much laughter>
H: 38. So pu-lî-kh__-lî, right?
CL: 39. Yeah.
H: 40a. <making grotesque gestures> When your shins are like this, and your head, your face—
like this—that's what you call pu-lî-kh__-lî in Lahu.
<laughter>
40b. Pu-lî-kh__-lî means "all laughing and pursed"—a pursed mouth—
Cà-g_â_: 41. You ask me things and I'll answer you back—'today where did you go,' 'I went 
there', 'I went here'—
CL: 42. Yes, that's great, great!
H: 43. Yes, yes, I'll ask.
Cà-g_â_: 44. Is it already turned on? Has it been going like this the whole time? Can [our voices] 
enter it already?
CL: 45a. Let this [tape] finish first. Then we'd like to put in a new one.
45b. [To me, in English] Do you want to start another one?
JAM: 46. [In English] Ask them if they want to hear what they just said.
CL: 47. Wait a second.  I'll just put in a new one.
H: 48. What'll we do? Hunting? We've already recorded about hunting. Shall we do "hunting 
squirrels," Cà-g_â_?
CL: 49. Let's also {record/ do} about fighting wars!
49b. You've fought alongside the Chinese, haven't you?
49c. Like that time when we were fighting Japan.
49d. Can't you [talk about] the Japanese coming up [to Shan State] and the Thais coming up 
there, and their fighting each other?
49e. The White man chased them out, and the Japanese fled, you can say.
49f. If it hadn't been for the airplanes coming like that—
H: 50. <talking to the boys playing the guitar>
You tap on the upper part like this, there on the upper part [of the neck of the guitar] you press 
upwards [i.e., higher up on the strip] or you press downwards.
CL: 51a. Yeah, like this?…
51b. The thing is you have to use all five [fingers], five of them.
51c. If you can do this you can earn a lot of money.
51d. People who do this in White Man's country in one night they get a thousand [baht, 
presumably]—
