68 The Rabbit and the Tiger

<told by Headman Cà-bí>

1. H: We-e-ll, brethren of min, I'll just tell you a story about how a rabbit and a tiger matched wits with 
each other! Do you want to hear it? Who wants to hear it?
2. Several voices: {I want to hear! I want to hear_		       {I want to hear too!
3. They say that long, long ago rabbits were very {clever/ smart/ intelligent}.
4. And in the old days tigers didn't bite people and eat them.
5. They didn't even eat raw meat.
6. Rabbits lived among humans, and tigers lived among humans.
7. One day a tiger and a rabbit {made friends with each other, became friends} and went along together 
towards a place where humans were living.
8. When they got there, Rabbit[1] said to a child, "Oh look there! That tiger says that when your father 
and mother come back from finding you food he'll also be waiting to eat with you all."
9. When he said this, he was {betraying/ deceiving} Tiger, that rabbit was.[2]
10. Rabbit was very smart, so he ran the hell away.[3]
11. As for Tiger, he frightened the children in that [human] house, the little kids in that house, and they 
were crying!
12. When the father and mother came home, [the father] took a knife and chased after Tiger, slashing at 
him and {beating/ striking at} him.
13. Tiger for his part followed the path over there that Rabbit had taken a while before, saying [to 
himself], "Rabbit betrayed me, so I'll just bite and eat him[4]," and he went chasing after Rabbit.
14. Rabbit went on and on, and {there in a certain place} on the path he gathered together a great bit 
pile of buffalo-shit and sat down near it to keep watch over it.
15. Tiger said, "The one who betrayed me just now must have been you. Today I'm going to eat you 
up."
16. R: "No, no! It sure wasn't me" he [Rabbit] said.
17. T: "What are you doing there?" he [Tiger] said.
18. R: Long, long ago, in the age of my ancestors, in the time of my {ancient/great} forefathers, they 
gave me this stool[5] and made me sit near it and watch over it," he said.
19. T: "Oh, I beg you to let me sit on it for a while!" said Tiger. If you say it in Shan, he said "y__n 
na_ ít m__."[6] That means "Let me sit for a while."
20. R: "Oh, that's impossible. In the time of my ancient forefathers, they said that if I let anybody else 
sit on it, it would collapse!
21. "However, I can't not let you sit on it," said Rabbit to Tiger.
22. When Tiger started to sit down, Rabbit jumped up, turned around, and ran the hell out of there.
23. Tiger sat down heavily,[7] and the buffalo-shit stuck to his arse in a big {yellow/brown} gloppy 
mess.
24. When the buffalo-shit stuck onto him, Tiger said, "That Rabbit deceives people!" and he suddenly 
went chasing after him again.
25. When he chased him down again, he said "The one who lied to me must have been you."
26. Rabbit was sitting up on a crooked branch of a tree, near a great big honeycomb, with his ears 
pricked up, saying to Tiger that he was watching over a huge gong.[8]
27. Then when [Tiger] said, "Rabbit, you're tricking me," [Rabbit] said "No-o-o! Ages ago in my 
forefathers' time they entrusted me with this great duty" [to watch over the gong]."
28. "Oh, I beg you to let me try striking it once, please let me strike it just once![9] Tiger said.
29. "Impossible," said Rabbit. "Impossible."
30. "Oh, please I beg you to let me strike it!" said Tiger.
31. "Well, if you do strike it, I'll just have to jump up and turn around," said Rabbit, and he jumped up 
and ran away.
32. Tiger then smashed his fist into the honeycomb over there.
33. The bees went inside [his body] and bit him, and his nose got all swollen, his mouth got tiny,[10] 
his mouth swelled up, his head and his face got huge.
34. So then Tiger said, "That Rabbit lied to me[11]!" and went chasing after him again_he was quite 
expert at following trails, that Tiger.
35. He was always chasing to attack.
36. Some distance away [Rabbit] had coiled a green pit viper[12] around a black log, an old dried out 
piece of wood by the side of the road in an abandoned field, and put it to sleep warming itself in the 
sun.
37. "Rabbit, you deceived me," he [Tiger] said. "I'm going to bite into you and eat you up, this very 
day."
38. "Oh, no!" he [Rabbit] said. "Long, long ago, in the time of my forefathers, in the time of my 
{grandparents/grandpa + grandma}, they put me in charge of guarding this curved tobacco-pipe."
39. So Tiger said he would like to try smoking[13] it just once. (He was using the Shan language, [as 
was normal] long, long ago.) "I'd like to try smoking ust one puff from that big pipe."
40. "Impossible, pal of mine![14] I have been entrusted with it since the time of my ancient 
forefathers," he said.
41. Well, he {finally could not but/ended up having to} let him have a smoke.[15]
42. So tiger eagerly went for that green head of the pit viper, that coiled-up head, thinking that even one 
puff would be delicious, and his great big mouth swelled up
So then_and this was not all[16]_Rabbit ran the hell away again and [Tiger] raced after him, and over 
there in a place in the mountains, Rabbit saw a human being who was arranging some thatch-grass to 
pick up and carry home.
"Rabbit, where are you going?" he said.
"Oh, there's a tiger that's chasing me to eat. The tiger is running after me and beating me.[17] I'm 
nearly dead. Where could I go to escape [him]?"
"Come inside my load of thatch-grass!" said the human to Rabbit.
Whoosh![18] He went into the load of thatch.
Well, having followed him again, Tiger got there, all amazed with buffalo-shit, with swollen eyes where 
the bees had stung him, with his mouth swelled up where the viper bit him[19], and said, "Haven't you 
seen a rabbit around here?"
"No, I haven't," he [the human] said.
"Wow, you're such a tiny little person, but your load is so big! Let me carry it a little," said Tiger.
The human said, "That's impossible."
So he begged him, "Pu-leeze[20] just let me just carry it a little!
"Your load is too big for you!"
So then [the human] said to Tiger, "Let's make an end to your damn[21] begging!"
 From inside that thatch something was going kh___-kh___![22]
 Hey, I wonder what's inside your thatch? Something is going kh___-kh___!" he [Tiger] said.
"Oh, it's just the thatch rattling around," he said.
It was Rabbit inside there that was {lighting a fire in the thatch/ setting the thatch on fire}.
Tiger was staggering under the weight.
 It was going t___-t___
A flint had been struck there.
" Oh, I wonder what in the world is in your thatch! It's going t___-t___ now."
"The thatch is just rattling around," the human said.
All of a sudden the thatch {burned brightly/ caught the hell on fire}; the flames leapt high.[23]
[Tiger] didn't have the sense to throw it away, you see, so he ran away all in fire, not looking for 
human beings anymore, and fled {as deep as he could[24] into/ into the most overgrown parts of} some 
old abandoned fields.
Well, there were large herds of horses and cattle grazing there.
"Mr. Ox,[25] Mr. Horse,[26] where {could might} I run away to today?"
"Run into the most overgrown part of the abandoned field over there," they said.
When he tried to flee into the deepest part of the abandoned field he was burning so badly that his flesh 
became {all striped/ covered with big stripes},[27] that mighty tiger.[28]
He couldn't flee {to a safe place/successfully}.
So then, after running and running he caught sight of a water-buffalo bathing in a buffalo-wallow.
"Oh, Mr. Buffalo, today I'm burning almost to death. Where can I run to get away?"
"Come on in here," he [Mr. Buffalo] said.
When he went into the pool the fire died, the fire just died.
The charred parts where the fire burned him, some of those burnt spots were now black and others 
were {blue/ green}, his eyes were {swollen/ puffed out}, his mouth had become huge, he had sat on a 
pile of buffalo-shit, and those black-and-blue stripes_he was a terrible mess!
That hive of bees that he hit mistaking it[29] for a gong bit into him so his eyes swelled up.
And the pit-viper making his mouth all {bent out of shape/ crooked} was because he [Rabbit] had told 
him [Tiger] that it [Mr. Viper] was a pipe, a crooked tobacco-pipe, so he said he would just take a puff, 
and [the viper] bit into him and his mouth got all swollen.
After that he got burned until he had stripes of bare[30] flesh, all red and raw[31], and ran to the cattle, 
ran to the horses, but wasn't saved.
They just showed him the way to an abandoned field.
When he reached a pool he went into it {with a water-buffalo/ where a water-buffalo was}, and was 
saved.
So to this day, even if a water-buffalo should do something against God's will, even if he is guilty of 
sins and crimes, a tiger will not bite him.
But a tiger has no respect for horses or cattle.
To this very day tigers eat them.
And that's the story.

[1] Rabbit evidently reached the human habitation before Tiger did. From now on we usually omit the article and capitalize 
the animals' names. They are usually referred to with the determiner chi 'this': patây chi 'this the rabbit' lâ chi 'this 
the tiger'.

[2] i.e., he was blowing Tiger's cover. The humans probably wouldn't have been willing to share their food with him, 
having been forewarned.

[3] ph_ 	gè_-e. gè_-e (< g__ 'be fast') is an intensifier added to certain verbs (esp. of motion). DL 408_FLEE	INTENS

[4] chè_ câ ve: the usual Lahu expression for being devoured by an animal._BITE EAT

[5] The pun with stool = excrement is fortuitous!

[6] Lit. "beg to-sit-one-time." This story is evidently of Shan origin, since this Shan phrase stuck in the narrator's mind. 
See also Sentence #28.

[8] I.e., Rabbit pretended that the bees' nest was a gong.

 [9] Tiger says it first in Shan (y__n mâun), then in Lahu (l__ d___)_			BEG STRIKE		BEG 
STRIKE

[10] Because of the stings around his mouth, his oral orifice was almost completely blocked.

 [11] Lit. "lies to people," but the non-3rd person benefactive Pv lâ shows that Tiger means that he is the object of 
deception.


 [12] v__-n_ Trimeresurus popeorum. Only slightly venomous, but with a very painful bite.

[13] He uses a Lahuized Shan loanword lù_ for 'smoke'.

 [14] Rabbit uses the friendly Shan-derived word _aháy 'buddy; pal', ult. Pali saha_ya 'friend, ally'. See DL: 1158.

[15]  t_: causative of d__ 'drink; smoke (tobacco)', like Jse. tabako wo nomaseru < nomu 'drink; smoke'.

 [20] Tiger uses the Shan word y__(n) 'beg' instead of normal Lahu l__. See sentence #28, above.

 [21] This expletive translates qh_ (Pv) 'iterative excess'. At this point the human gives Tiger the load to carry.

 [25] JAM changed from cà-qa_ to cà-nû. INTERNAL NOTE.

 [26] Tiger adds the male name prefix cà to the animals (cà-nû, cà-mû), which creates a humorous humanizing effect, since 
most traditional Lahu men's names were derived from the day in the 12-day calendrical cycle when the boy was born. 
See DL 448-451.

[27] As tigers are to the present day!
