39 The Trickster's Spear and the Merchants

1. Well, then, there was still another Trickster. [1]
2. He put down a packet of rice on the lower part of a road.
3. On the upper part of the road he put a packet of curry. [2]
4. When he was ambling along carrying a spear, a band of traders came along, and [he said to 
them]:
5. "Hey you guys, don't do any [other] trading now![3]
6. Just trade me your things! And I'll give you this spear.
7. I trade this spear of mine for your [stuff].
8. This spear of mine has magic powers!
9. If you stick it down to the lower part of the road, you get rice to eat.
10. If you stick it down into the upper part of the road, you get meat to eat," he said—
11. So then those traders said {"Let's check it out!"/"Try doing it!"}, and when they did it, when 
they stuck it into [the earth on] the lower part of the road, they got a packet of rice.
12. When they stuck it into the upper part of the road, they got a packet of chicken.
13. So then they were {ecstatic/very happy}, and they thought, "It's true!" and after the Orphan 
had {obtained/gotten} their horses [in exchange], when that band of traders got hungry, they 
thrust that spear down into the lower part of the road, but they didn't get anything.
14. When they thrust it into the upper part of the road they got nothing.
15. So when this happened they wept and went back home.

Footnotes:
[1] I.e., "here's another Trickster story." The trickster is here referred to either by his name (__-
qh__ ~ __-qhay) or as "the orphan" (Sentence #13, below). The wily orphan is one of Trickster's 
manifestations. The hapless group of (Chinese) traders is another stock motif of these stories.
[2] __-chî (lit. "rice-enhancer, -elevator"): that which is eaten with rice, conventionally translated 
'curry'. Cf. Thai kàpkhâaw.
[3] Instead of the usual negative imperative adverb mâ, Trickster here uses the clause-final Pv 
mâ-y_, which conveys a brusque or ironic impression. See DL: 974.
