17 Sprits that Bite and Those that Don't
[Tape II, Side 1 #8]
	1 This spirit, you see, when this master-spirit is hungry for meat, he takes a 
pitchfork1 and hooks it fast onto a {human being / man}, [so that] if he [=the man] doesn't 
feed him tasty food, he will fiercely make the human being waste away.2 But if the man 
goes to consult the spirit-doctor,3 the doctor [will say]:
	3 "The reason why your body has become thin is, that the sky-spirit wanted to eat 
delicious food through you, so he has treated you {this way / like this}. 4 However, if you 
cook up some good-tasting food and feed it to him, you will be cured. 5 {If you don't / 
Unless you} feed him, that pitchfork will stay hooked onto you. 6 But4 as soon as you do 
feed him, he'll take it all [away] and your body will be healthy [again]."
	7 This kind of spirit can also start to cause trouble5 for the whole household. 8 
However, as far as the kind [of spirit] that cannot bite goes, we simply pay homage to 
them.6 9 We, er--we do not worship the kind that can bite. 
	10 If we were to speak about what forms7 the biting kind of spirits have, seeing as 
how there are so many of them, since they are everywhere--water-spirits, rock-spirits, 
mountain-spirits, valley-spirits, tree-spirits, thunder-spirits--there are all kinds of spirits.
	11 However--nevertheless--even though there is such a large number of them, 
this kind of spirits that can bite are all inferior to us human beings. 12 This is the way the 
matter stands.
