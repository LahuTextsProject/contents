107a A Yellow Lahu Burns his Fingers
[Tape X, Side 1]
[107a-d originally told in Y.L., then translated into B.L.]
	1 Once upon a time there were two men.1 2 [This is about how] one day the two 
of them picked some {cabbages / mustard-greens} to boil up for a curry:2 3 They got up 
to the fields, and when noontime came the two of them were looking for [something to] 
{cook / boil up} for a curry. 4 So the Yellow Lahu said to the Black Lahu: "Let's go boil up 
some {cabbages / mustard-greens}." 5 After a while they went and {cooked / boiled} the 
cabbage. 6 They cooked it, and it came to a boil.3 7 After it was done, when he4 had 
mixed up some salt and hot peppers [in a dish], he said "Friend, scoop out a little, will 
you?" 8 Then, after a few seconds,5 he {repeated / said [again]}, "Friend, scoop out a 
little salt, will you?" 9 Now the way the Black Lahu said it was because he didn't 
understand the Yellow Lahu dialect. 10 So that he [ended up] making the Yellow Lahu 
scoop out some cabbage. 11 Well, it was burning hot, and the Yellow Lahu jumped--er, 
the Yellow Lahu ran away [in pain].
