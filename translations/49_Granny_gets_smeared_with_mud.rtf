[1] The split bamboo floor of the veranda often buckles under one's weight if a false step is 
made, resulting in a slow descent into the mud under the house.  (This happened to the author 
one morning as he was brushing his teeth on Cà-bo's veranda.  Trying not to laugh, Cà-bo led me 
to the stream to wash off.
[2] jè_-n__ tí ph___ _e_-ò: lit. "became only mud unfortunately."
