119 A Lahu Gives a Shan a Good Cursing
[Tape X, Side 2]
	1 Well, once there was a certain man. 2 He met a1--er, as he was on his way to 
work,2 he met a Shan [woman]. 3 When he met the Shan,3 he had many people with 
him.4 4 Well, he wanted5 to say to the Shan "I'm very hungry, very hungry!" 5 [But] what 
he said was, "Madam, my stomach is very full!"6
	6 So then the Shan [lady] said, "Since your stomach is full, why don't you7 lie 
down here for a while7?," and she got a pillow and put it down for him. 7 Well, he kept 
thinking that he would get something to eat, so he went on waiting.8 8 He waited and 
waited, [but] he still wasn't getting anything to eat.9 9 When [he saw] he was being 
treated this way,10 he got angry.
	10 When he got angry, he decided he would curse out the Shan [woman], and 
said "Hey, boys, boys12! You run along ahead.13 11 I'm just going to tell this Shan off14 
first!" 
	12 Then, after the boys had left, he said: "You damned Lahu! I eat your shit, 
sir!"15
[laughter]
13 Then he went off. 14 When he reached his destination,16 when he saw his people, he 
said, "I really told that Shan a thing or two!"17

Footnotes
1. The original interrupted text has has "y__ pî-ch__--," lit., "he (topic) a Shan (object)." 
Since the verb does not come till the end of a Lahu sentence, but is required before the 
object of an English sentence, the Lahu {sequence / frustum} NPtopic + NPobject is 
untranslatable. 
2. Lit: "within (the time) he was going off to earn his livelihood (= eat)."
3. Lahu narratives (indeed TB narrations in general) often use the device of linking one 
sentence to another by echoing the final clause of the preceding sentence in the first 
clause of the next sentence. See also below Sent. 9/10. 
4. Lit: "his people were numerous."
5. The idea of volition is expressed by the Pv of intent a. 
6. He wanted to say something like yâ khi na (hiw khâaw mâag), but aid instead pú ka_ 
na (appropriate when one politely refuses the offer of mou food?-CHECK). The similarity 
between these expressions is more situational than phonological. The Lahu man knew a 
couple of Shan set expressions related to eating, but mixed them up.
7. The durative nuance conveyed by 'for a while' is provided by the Pv ta, which may be 
used to indicate that the action of the verb will be prolonged or quasi-permanent. The 
'why don't you' translates the suggestion-particle a~á (CHECK). cf. Vv a-ni. 
8. I.e., he thought that the pillow was intended to make him more comfortable while he 
waited for his meal. 
9. Lit: 'he always couldn't get anything to eat.;
10. Lit: 'when (they) did it that way (to him).' a-lâ (No, probably just benefactive lâ) ~ 
qha-lâ is an emphatic Pv.
11. V + a-t__ te 'to decide to V.' See grammar, _____.  
12. His companions on the way to the field (See Sentence 3).
13. "go fast!"
14. dê lò_ 'tell off,' lit. "scold (dê) so it goes in (=pierces) (lò_)." 
15. The Lahu had intended to say "Dammed Shan! You eat my shit!" Further adding to 
the humor is his use of the Shan polite final particle l___ (_ Thai khra_b), here 
translated "sir." The intended direction of coprophagy was reversed--one can imagine 
the poor kind woman's amazement. 
16. Lit: 'when he got there.'
17. He uses the classifier for inanimate (mà) instead of the one for people (g_â). This 
is sometimes (as here) slightly insulting, though other speakers occasionally use mà 
in this sense with no such intention.
