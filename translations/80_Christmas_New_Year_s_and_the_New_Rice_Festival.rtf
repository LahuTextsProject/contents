80 Christmas, New Year's, and the New Rice Festival

Cà-bo (abbreviated both "C" and "T" [teacher]; Headman ("H"), Thû-yì, the Kachin, Khù-M__, 
Yâ-Pa_-__

1. H: Well, this Christian group of ours, we Lahu living in Huey Tat village, will celebrate 
Christmas when the year 1965 is almost over and just before 1966 arrives.  All of us, from olden 
times until today, have observed this custom from generation to generation.  Therefore on 
December 24th Christmas will be here for us. [1] Everybody should prepare in {in 
advance/beforehand} before December 24th arrives, everything that we'll be using, like rice and 
wood.  Unhusked rice, hulled rice—prepare them both properly, everybody prepare carefully the 
food for us to eat at Christmas.  When the time comes, we shouldn't do any work.  I'm telling 
this to everybody.

2 . T: Well, yes, we should prepare and make ready.  You're saying that we'll enter the 
Christmas season after dark on the 24th, right?

3. H: Yes.  We'll {enter/begin} Christmas {on the evening of/after dark on} the 24th.

4. T: Uh-huh.

5. H: When [Jesus] was born.

6. T: Aren't we indeed commemorating the birth of Jesus!  So in our Lahu language how should 
we say it?  "Christmas" is an English [2] word.

7. H: Well, we could call it "Welcoming Jesus' Birth around the New Year" in {Lahu/our Lahu 
language}.

8. T: Well, if I think about [it in] our Lahu language, I think we ought to call it "The Happy 
Festival." [3]  Jesus' birth was [a] happy [event], so everybody please call it "The Happy 
Festival."  So, when shall we celebrate New Year's?

9. H: Celebrating New Year's?

10. T: Yes.

11. H: Well, the day that we celebrate New Year's [4]—if we {celebrate/start celebrating} "the 
Happy Festival" on December 24th, when the 25th arrives, we can really have a good time.  In 
the daytime.

12. T: Yes.

13. H: When [Xmas] is over, how many days should we still take off, in {your/you guys'} 
opinion?

14. T: Well, we only celebrate New Year's once, at the beginning of the year.  I think we ought to 
take off three or four days.

15. H: Mm-hmm,  So you're saying, for New Year's, for these two years [old and new], it's only 
three or four days?

16. T: Not at all!  The "Happy Festival"  [alone] takes three days!

16 1/2. H: Oh.

17. T: So then, when it's time to celebrate New Year's, we should still take off three or four 
days.

18. H: Three days and four days. [5] So, you['re saying] it comes to seven days.  If it's three 
days plus four days.

19. T: If it extends to seven days, we'll have a proper rest, all of us.

20. H: I'll bet [6] you all want to {take off work/celebrate}. [7]  All you kids.

21. Pà-__: All of us want to celebrate.

22. Kachin: I want to celebrate.

23. H: Oh, they want to celebrate!  Hey Kachin, do you want to celebrate, seven days for New 
Year's?

24. Kachin: I do, I do! [8]

25. H: [laughs]

25 1/2. T: Well then, whose pig(s) shall we kill for Christmas?

26. Pà-__: Yours!

27. T: Mine?!  Mine probably couldn't be divided up! [9]  It's just not very big, that pig.

28. Pà-__: It could, it could! [be divided up]

29. Somebody: Hey, Khù-m__, you kill one [too]!  If there's not enough to divide up!

30. H: Oh, [mine] is a sow!  Its meat probably doesn't taste good!

31. T: If we kill Khù-m__'s too, then once it's New Year's we won't have any left to kill, in that 
case.

32. Kachin: I'll kill one too!

33. H: Well, Kachin, I guess yours will [make it] be enough!

34. T: Is yours a male?

35. Kachin: I've got a male, and I have a female too.

36. T: Oh.

37. H: Please kill the bigger one!

38. T: OK then, Headman, how many kilos {would you like to get/will you get}?

39. H: Oh, I'll take five kilos.  This year, when we're relaxing and having a good time we'll cook 
it up [the pork dishes] and set it aside [10], that's how we'll do it.

40. Pà-__: Hey, son-in-law! [11] Aren't you getting [12] about 10 kilos, I guess?

41. T: Ten kilos, eh?

41a. Pà-__: Yeah.

42. H: What about you?

43. T: Well, I guess I'd like two kilos [for Xmas] and three kilos [for New Year's].

44. H: (laughing) In that case it comes to 5 kilos!  If we do the math. [13]

45. T: Well then, Cà-qu-ní [14], how many kilos are you getting?

46. Thûyì: I'll take 4 kilos and 5 kilos.

47. H: (laughing) 4 kilos and 5 kilos.

48. T: 9 kilos.

49. H: My goodness, that's plenty then.

50. T: That's probably not enough.  {Look for/find} another animal [=pig], one more.  Let's still 
look for one more pig.  So, let's think over whose we should find.

51. H: Let's kill Cà-l__'s [15]. Cà-l__, I guess we should kill yours.

52. T: The big male.

53. Cà-l__: I'll kill it.

54. H: A-ha.

55. T: Cà-l__ says he'll kill one of his.  In that case there'll be enough!

56. H: Since it's very big, eh?

57. T: That's plenty, plenty then.  Until the end of the New Year's celebrations, nobody go off 
anywhere, please!  [If you're] all by yourself that's no fun.  If a person doesn't take time off to 
celebrate, that's depressing.  The thing is to take time off.  Do as we have discussed.

58. H: Right.

59. T: We {can't must not} do as we have discussed.  {Make your plans/ think it over} carefully 
right now.  Otherwise, when the time eventually comes around later, it'll be like they say, "By 
the time you realize what's happening you can't do anything about it." [16] Or, as they say, "By 
the time a woman feels she's pregnant she has burdens aplenty!"—when the time comes there'll 
be nothing you can do.

60. H: So everybody should make their plans {in good/ at the right} time. [17]  Every household.  
Because we in Huey Tat are so few in number, aren't we!  If we try counting the houses [in the 
village], there are maybe 20 of them. [18] There just aren't that many people!  To be precise 
about the [number of] people, [19] if we say it, in Northern Thai, there are just "p___ sî_ pái"! 
[20] If we say it in Lahu, there are only hí chi g_â [80 people], these people of ours.  {Talk it 
over, talk it over/ discuss it, discuss it}, everybody try talking it over, from now on whatever 
you do you ought to do it together.  How many deep each time [for X-mas and New Year's 
respectively] [21] will everybody take off work to celebrate [22], you {graybeards/ gray heads/ 
gray-headed elders} ought to count heads and think it over, right? [laughs] [Otherwise] one of 
these days if somebody wants to take off and somebody else doesn't want to, if one says "Do it 
this way," "Do it that way" there will be all kinds of {things to quarrel about/ ___ of contention/ 
controversies}, won't there!  Everybody think it over carefully.

61. Pa_-__: If we just take off {as long as / the way} we usually do it should be enough.

62. H: Yeah.

63. T: If we just do things brashly without regard to others' opinions [23] we could become a 
laughing stock!

64. H: Right.  Well then, everybody agrees I guess.  Taking time off the way we usually have 
done, like our ancestors of old also used to celebrate for generation after generation.  Is that right?

65. Somebody: That's right then.

66. Thû-Yì: There must be at least one person who doesn't agree.

67. Pa_-__: {I doubt it/ there probably isn't}

68. H: [If you don't agree] speak out!  Otherwise later on [you might say] "I wasn't satisfied but 
I didn't say anything! I'm the kind of person who doesn't say anything when he doesn't agree." 
Say what's on your mind!  If you don't agree, please tell us!

69. Pa_-__: Everybody agrees probably.

70. H: OK. If [you all] agree that's fine!  By the grace of God, in joy and happiness we [will] 
celebrate the new fruits of our labor [24], and having reached the days and nights of the New 
Year, everyone happily will live in peace and harmony; and we'll just try to keep on doing all 
kinds of work, won't we!

71. T: Well then, when shall we celebrate the New Rice Festival this year?  The time to celebrate 
it is getting close!  After we've finished discussing the matter of celebrating New Year's, let's 
{try going on to talk/ have a go at talking} about the New Rice Festival.  This is the time to do 
it—otherwise some people will be around [25] but others aren't—it'll be impossible to discuss 
later.

72. H: Well, we've always celebrated the New Rice Festival in October, every year!

73. T: October is getting close!

74. H: If it's not on this coming October the eighth [26], we've celebrated it in the past on the 
4th, the New Rice Festival.

75. T: But then, if we do it on the 4th, how in the world will we be able to carry the rice home?

76. H: Hmm—

77. T: It's not something that can be done in just two or three days.  It's the rainy season!  It's 
not the hot season!

78. H: Well, we've celebrated it on the 4th, in the past!

79. T: As for when they celebrated it in the past, just because we remember {that/ a certain} 
year, a certain time, it's impossible to celebrate it at that same time every year.  Some years 
there's no rain, other years the rain goes on and on. [27]

80. H: We've also [sometimes] celebrated it on the 14th, the New Rice.

81. T: In that case let's just do it on the 14th.

82. H: Mm-hm.  The New Rice—

83. T: Who—you're going to invite people, right? [i.e., from their villages]

84. H: Well, I think it would be good to invite our Lahu {relatives/ brethren} who live in all the 
nearby villages!

85. T: In that case you guys have to think about food and drink now!

86. Somebody: Well, as for food, I'll contribute a pig all by myself!

87. T: All by yourself?

88.  Somebody: Yes.

89. Somebody else: In that case, the meat—

90. T: In that case who all will contribute extra food for second helpings? [28] If there's only a 
small amount it won't be enough.  Since you're inviting other people.  What do you say?

91. H: I don't actually have very much pork.  Because mine is a female.  There's only three or 
four kilos [29], I'd say.

92. Pa_-__: If there's not enough, I'll kill {an elephant/ one of my elephants} and contribute it.

93. Somebody: An elephant?

94. Pa_-__: Yep.

95. T: My goodness, people could never finish paying for it, I bet!  An elephant—[laughter] Is it 
a male or a female, this elephant of yours?

96. Pa_-__: It's a male, I think. [30]

97. T: A male.  My goodness, my goodness!  Who all is there who doesn't eat elephant meat?

98. Pa_-__: People don't eat it, elephant meat.

99. H: Oh, it's very tasty.

100. T: I'd like to try eating it myself, elephant meat!  Since I've never eaten it.

101. H: Elephant meat is tough and chewy, so it's delicious!  We've {gotten/ had a chance} to eat 
it before.

102. Thû-yì: Let's divide it into shares!  I'll take my whole share [of meat for the festival] from 
the elephant meat!

103. T: Dividing it into shares, I doubt you'd be able to pay for it.

104a. H: How many thousand baht—

105a. T: How many thousand baht for yours—

104b. H:—will you charge for it?

105b. T:—are you intending to contribute it for?

106. Pa_-__: I'm not changing anything.  I'm contributing it for free.

107. T: So you'll kill it and contribute it?

108. Pa_-__: Yeah.

109. T: That's great then!

110. Somebody: It sounds like he's saying he'll divide it up into shares.

111. Somebody else: I hear that Khù-m__ also has an elephant to kill and contribute, an elephant.  
To eat it at the New Rice Festival.

112. Khù-m__: Since I'm doing it for charity, I won't accept any payment.

113. H: For my part I've got one pig!  A sow, with only about seven or eight kilos of meat.

114. T: Well, I'll also contribute three basketfuls [tû] of rice [31].  Look for other contributors of 
rice!  Cà-qu-ní (= Thû-yì), how much will you put in?

115. Thû-yì: For my part I guess I'll put in one or two baskets full [tû].

116. T: Just one or two basketfuls [tû].  Hey, you Kachin over there!  Jingpho guy! [32]

117. Kachin: Oh, five or five and a half basketsful [tû].

118. T: Five and a half basketsful [tû].  Well, that's great.  So Cà-lâ over there!  How much will 
you put in?

119. Cà-lâ: Who, me?  Well, I'll contribute three tû or two tû!

120. T: Three tû or two tû.  Yes, that's plenty, that's plenty.  Well then, when you've invited 
people and they've come, don't do anything embarrassing, anything that would bring shame to 
anybody, OK, all of you?  As for this bunch of young guys, don't you go courting the girls.  If 
you want to do some courting, just do it at home.

121. Pa_-__: I do want to court the girls.

122. T: As for courting now, do go and court each other.  But don't do bad things, any of you. 
[33]

123. Thû-yì: I probably will!  The others will too, I bet.  So maybe I will too [34] [laughter].

124. Pa_-__: So, you guys, it's up to you all to think this over.

125. T: In any case lots of girls will come.

126. H: They'll come, they'll come.

127. Thû-yì: What kind of girls?

128. T: From up there, around _á-to-do_, M_-m__-nw__ and Vê-kh__ villages they'll come!

129. H: You should mention Vê-kh__ and Vê-là_.

130. T: Yes.

131. Thû-yì: Ah, that's exactly what I've been thinking about.

132. H: (laughing) You'll be very happy, won't you, when the girls come.

133. Somebody: Up and at 'em, you guys! [laughter]

134. H: They're all young men, and when the New Rice Festival comes, when Christmas comes, 
they're just hoping and waiting for girls.  Since they're all young guys. [35]

135. T: They also contribute a lot of money, some of them.  They have plenty of money.  Well, 
Cà-l__, you'll come too, won't you, when the time to celebrate the New Rice comes.

136. Cà-l__: Oh, I'll certainly come.

136a. T: Ah.

137. H: Come and enjoy yourselves, the two of you! [36] Don't shave off that beard.  We'll offer 
you pork fat until it's dripping

138. T: This beard is all bushy, as it'll be a sight to see when it's sticky with porkfat!

139.  JAM: A sight to see, eh?

140. T: Yeah, a great sight to see.

[1] It is not clear why the date isn't Dec. 25th.  Rather like the Jewish practice of beginning 
holidays at nightfall of the preceding day!
[2] kâlâ-phu-kh__: lit. "white Indians' language".
[3] pw__-ha-l__
[4] H. was unprepared for this change of subject to New Year's, and goes back to talking about 
Xmas.
[5] I.e., three days for Xmas and 4 days for New Year's
[6] "I'll bet" translates the nf n__-__ 'suppositional'.
[7] ch__: 'to be in a place, dwell'; in this context it means 'to stop work during a festival'.
[8] "Want to celebrate, want to celebrate."
[9] I.e., it wouldn't be big enough to share among the villagers.
[10] Until the guests come, when it will be heated up and served.
[11] Pa_-__ is role-playing here as if he were the Headman's father-in-law—he was an unmarried 
youth of about 17 when this was recorded.
[12] Approximate quantification via reduplication: tê chi kîlô-lô.  Could also say tê-chi-chi kîlô.
[13] tà ni a qo __: lit. "if [we] begin to look [at it]."
[14] This is Thû-yì's nickname as transcribed in my 1965 field notes.  It might mean 'hairless 
one' (cf. ni ~ ní 'red; naked').  But DL 449 has Cà-qu-n___ as his nickname.
[15] More play-acting.  Cà-l__ was my chief consultant on the 1965-66 fieldtrips, and lived in 
Chiang Mai, not in Huey Tat, and didn't have a pig to his name!
[16] T. here segues into two proverbs one after the other.  The first one means literally "When 
your thoughts catch up you cannot catch the thing" (When think-catch cannot chase-catch).

[18] On my most recent trip to Huey Tat in 20__, the village had grown to some 100 houses 
with ___ people.
[19] Lit. "If we say carefully the people"
[20] "More than eighty." Cf. Siamese p___t sìp paj
					8x10	 more than
[21] This meaning is conveyed by the reduplication of qhà-nî ni 'how many days?'
[22] This is an important issue.  In a subsistence culture based on constant work in the growing 
season, villagers are often loath to take time off from vital work in the fields.
[23] pò-m___-pò-_ê "exceed that which is appropriate" < Shan.
[24] cà-__-__ câ ve 'eat [celebrate] the New Rice festival', lit., "eating the rice from the new 
paddy": a harvest festival carried over from pre-Christian times, surviving from pre-Christian 
times, celebrated some time in October.
[25] In this sentence ch__ has its basic meaning of 'be in a place; stay', rather than the extended 
sense 'take time off for a holiday'.
[26] The Clf tâ_, from the verb tâ_ 'climb', traditionally referred to days of the waxing moon, 
but when the Christian Lahu reckon dates according to the Western calendar they use the same clf 
like our ordinal numerals (tê tâ_ 'the first' ["one climbing"], nî tâ_ 'the 2nd', etc.), with the 
counting beginning from the first of the calendar month, not from the new moon.
[27] mû-yè mu 'the rain is high'
[28]  __-phâ_-__-l__: phâ 'to exceed'; l__ 'be left over, extra' (< Tai; cf. Si. ly_a).
[29] A scrawny sow indeed!
[30] The suppositional use of n__-__ 'probability' is humorous here, since there is absolutely no 
difficulty in determining whether an elephant is male or not.
[31] tû : < Shan tun.  1 tû = 1 pî_ = 1 pû
[32] A longtime and well-liked resident of Huey Tat, this Jingpho man evidently made the trip 
from Burma to Thailand with the rest of the villagers.
