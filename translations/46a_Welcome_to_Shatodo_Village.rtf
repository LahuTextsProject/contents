Footnotes:
[1] A large Christian village in Thailand, about 120 km north of Chiang Mai, on the River Kok on 
the Burmese border. The name _á-to-do ~ _á-to-du_ is from Thai s_ntôndùù (s_n 'ridge' and 
tôndùu Pterocarpus macrocarpus [a large beautiful timber tree]).
[2] The notion of totality is emphatically conveyed by using three separate constructions: Nqh + 
tê pha_ 'all the Nqh'; tê g_â lê-le 'every person'; dê-dê 'all'. See DL: 631, 633, 709-10.
[3] qhà-ma ná (Puf): The particle ná expresses uncertainty. With this aside, the speaker is seeking 
confirmation of the population figure from the others present.
[4] Here the binome h_-___ is used instead of the simple noun h_ 'swidden'.
