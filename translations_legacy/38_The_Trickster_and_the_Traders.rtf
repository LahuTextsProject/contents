38 The Trickster and the Traders

1. Once upon a time there was a guy called __-qh__ the Trickster, [1] O Lahu!
2. This __-qh__, it seems, was able to make legs on an ashy pumpkin [2], and he sat down by the 
side of a road, and stayed sitting there.
3. A large group of traders arrived there to do business, driving a hundred donkeys [loaded with 
goods].
4. So then the Trickster said, "O traders, let's trade your donkeys for mine! [3]
5. "This one of mine brings forth many babies, and it's also very fast!" he said.
6. So then that group of traders thought "It's probably true," so they made the trade.
7. So then, after the Trickster had driven off that big group of donkeys, the bunch of traders [4] 
mounted his ashy pumpkin, and whipped it {diligently/ with all their might}.
8. But since they couldn't get it to move, they lifted it up and flung it into a m‡-kwi_ bush [5], 
whereupon two rabbits that had been in there jumped out fast, and when they did, when the 
rabbits jumped out and ran away, they thought "Yes! By the Buddha, yes, yes!"
9. "Catch 'em, catch 'em, catch 'em, catch 'em, go get 'em, go, go, go!" they said.
10. So after chasing them for three days without catching them, they wept and went back home.
