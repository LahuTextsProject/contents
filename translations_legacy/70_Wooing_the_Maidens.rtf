70 Wooing the Maidens
[Tape #6, Side 2 (continued in #77)]
1 Pà-__: Thû-yì, where are you going tonight?
2 Thû-yì: Well, I guess I'll go try {courting the girls / wooing me a maiden} tonight.
3 Pà-__: Whereabouts?
4 Thû-yì: Oh, over there where all the girls are. i've been planning to have a go at it.
5 Pà-__: When you go, call me, too, please. I'll just have something to eat first.
6 Thû-yì: Well, the two of us are good friends, so let's {get together / join up} and go. 
7 Pà-__: People like us ought to join up and do it together.
8 Cà-l__: Won't you {invite / call} me, too, then?
9 Thû-yì: Oh, you can go, too, {pal1 / my friend}! Now there are three!
10 Cà-l__: Yep.
11 Pà-__: The oldest one is mine!
12 Thû-yì: Oh, the best-looking one is mine!
13 Pà-__: It's impossible then.
14 Thû-yì: That's not right, old buddy. I'm the one who visited that {girl / one} of yours 
first, you know!
15 Pà-__: You say you visited her first, but I never saw you do it!2
16 Thû-yì: I've made a {proper / regular} {engagement / betrothal} with that one!
17 Pà-__: Come on, now, as far as betrothals go,3 you're not committed as much as I 
am.4
18 Thû-yì: Well, in that case, I'll switch to that younger sister of hers.5 If you take her on.
19 Pà-__: Go ahead, go ahead!
20 Thû-yì: You take on the older one--I'll take on the younger one.
21 Pà-__: Fine, fine.6 That's how I had it planned anyway.
22 Thû-yì: What about you, my friend?
23 Cà-l__: Me, you mean?
24 Thû-yì: Yeah.
25 Cà-l__: I haven't even managed to have a proper talk [with anybody] yet!7
26 Pà-__: Have a try at talking then. 
27 Thû-yì: Well, let's get going in a few minutes…. Oh, our friend is going to eat first 
now. Let's wait for him.
28  Càbo (to Thû-yì): Apparently this fellow's girl hasn't been much in the mood for 
courting with him, my friend.8
29 Thû-yì: I don't know. He told me that when he went to have a private talk with her,9 
she wouldn't even chat with him the way she should. [To Càl__] It's probably because 
you didn't do a very good job of making conversation with her! 
30 Cà-l__: The thing is I said too much to her. She didn't talk to me! She must've been 
embarrassed, I guess.
31 Pà-__: Because you just haven't gotten to know each other yet.10
32 Cà-l__: Probably so--that's probably it.
33 Pà-__: After two or three nights, {she'll / you'll} probably get {more familiar / friendlier}.
34 Thû-yì: Well, with me now, as far as conversation goes, when I go over there she 
talks to me even if I sit on the ground [outside] without even going into her house!
35 Cà-l__: Won't you please explain to me how you do it? Since I've never heard 
[anything about how it's done]!
36 Thû-yì: Oh, boy!11
37 Cà-l__: When you go, what's the first thing you say to the girl?
38 Pà-__: You take a stick and poke it through from underneath the floor.12 When she 
comes out you say "Have a chat with me!"
39 Cà-l__: You say "Have a chat with me," eh?
40 {Pà-__ / Thû-yì} : Right, right.
41 Cà-l__: Then what does she say13 to you?
42 Thû-yì: She says, "You say something first! What have you been thinking about?" 
But we have to tell her about our feelings.14
43 Cà-l__: What sort of thing?
44 Thû-yì: Whether we love her or not. She listens to what we say to her. 
45 Pà-__: We've got to tell her "I love you!"
46 Cà-l__: You've got to say "I love you," huh?
47 Pà-__: Yes.
48 Cà-l__: Can't you say "I don't love you"?
49 Pà-__: If we say "I don't love you," then they won't love us either.
50 Cà-l__: Hmm.
51 Thû-yì: But once we get her into the woods, we've got to ask, "What's your real 
reason for coming out here [with me] tonight?15 Did you come because you like me?" 
Then she says, "Well, I came here because I've been thinking about you. I wanted to 
have a good talk with you." 
52 Cà-l__: Then how do you {go on / continue} with it after that? Do you talk about all 
sorts of things?
53 Thû-yì: Well, after you've had your talk, you write letters to each other all day, and at 
night you go visit her. 
54 Cà-l__: Which one is it that you say you'll marry? The one {you visit all the time / 
you're visiting}? 
55 Thû-yì: That guy16 has taken her away from me now!
56 Cà-l__: Gee, there's no sense competing with each other like that, is there17? 
57 Thû-yì: Oh, that guy16 really {gives people17 a hard time / causes people a lot of 
trouble}!
58 Càbo: And the fellow is also very jealous, you know. 
59 Pà-__: I am not jealous. She likes me as I like her!
60 Cà-l__: Wow, is this girl so beautiful then? Why is it that so many people are fighting 
over her?
61 Thû-yì: Well, her body is beautiful. But her heart is fickle.18 There's nothing that can 
be done with her right now. 
62 Pà-__: Her body's beautiful, all right. But her heart is fickle.
63 Cà-l__: How old did you say she is?
64 Thû-yì: If you figure her age, I'd say she's around diez y seis or diez y siete.19
65 Pà-__: She's probably about seventeen.
66 Cà-l__: Can she read and write?20
67 Pà-__: Oh, she can read and write, too.
68 Cà-l__: How many grades did she finish21, in her studies?
69 Pà-__: The Lahu don't have school-grades like that! All we know is our ABC's22!
70 Thû-yì: Well, when she writes letters to me, they're very nice, too! The handwriting, I 
mean.
71 Cà-l__: What sort of thing does she write you? Won't you just read me a little so I'll 
know23?
72 Thû-yì: She writes me things like "Now, amidst my constant thoughts of you, I send 
you these few words24--This is what I want to say:" she says. "Night and day I think only 
of you."25
73 Cà-l__: Is that all? It couldn't be. It must be longer [than that].
74 Thû-yì: Well, there's still another part.
75 Cà-l__: Tell me all of it! I want to hear.
76 Thû-yì: She says, "You probably don't think of me day and night. But I can't even eat 
from thinking about you!" For my part I {say / write} to her: " Oh, I think of you also day 
and night, whether I sleep or whether I sit.26 But please, let us firmly resolve our hearts27 
and {do / make it} so that we may live together." 
77 Pà-__: She'll say [things like] "Even if I eat pure white rice, it is as chaff in my mouth!"28 
"Even if I drink pure water, it is as though I drank a foul draught."28
78 Cà-l__: I see.
79 Thû-yì: But some people just say those things with their mouths. In their hearts 
they're not in love.
80 Pà-__: Some people love with their body and soul, completely. Others may say it with 
their mouths, but it isn't so.
81 Thû-yì: Well, let's go then! If you're through eating we'll go a-courting!
82 Pà-__: Let's go.
83 Cà-l__: What time is it now?29
84 Thû-yì: Oh, it's probably about a las seis30 now.
85 Cà-l__: The moon hasn't come out yet, has it?
86 Pà-__: I certainly wouldn't think so, since we're only a las seis. At seven, at seven o' 
clock. 
87 Thû-yì: Well, I don't have a watch,31 so I don't know anymore. Because my watch is 
on the blink,32 damn it.
88 Pà-__: Mine is busted, too. But i'm used to it, so I can still tell the time from it.33
89 Cà-l__: Do the girls have watches on them [too].
90 Thû-yì: Does my girl have a watch? Well, she told me she didn't. When [I found out] 
she wanted one I told her I wouldn't be able to buy her one until I could go to 
Chiengmai.34
91 Cà-l__: Is that what you said?
92 Thû-yì: I've been planning to buy her one the next time I go to Chiengmai.35 I {wonder 
/ don't know} how much I'll have to pay--for a little tiny watch like this.
93 Pà-__: I'll bet you can get one for two or three hundred [baht].
94 Thû-yì: I can. For two or three hundred.
95 Pà-__: If the machinery [inside] isn't very good. If the works are fairly good….36
96 Cà-l__: A woman's watch, eh?--Say, why don't you go court a Thai girl? Haven't you 
ever done it?
97 Thû-yì: A Thai? Oh, once I did court a Thai, a while ago.
98 Cà-l__: Aha! Tell me about it, won't you? Tell me all about how it went.37
99 Thû-yì: About that? Well, the Thai now,38 they have a custom that you can only court 
inside the house. That doesn't suit me at all.39 They can't get together and go out into 
the woods like us Lahu. 
100 Pà-__: Those Thais, they'll love whoever goes to them--really!
101 Thû-yì: Sometimes40 even, while we're visiting them all nice and proper, some other 
guy comes too, and she talks to him at the same time--that really gets us mad!
102 Pà-__: Then we feel like clenching our firsts and having a fight!
103 Thû-yì: That's right. [That's why] the Thais are [always] fighting with each other.
104 Cà-l__: You say They're fickle, the Thai girls?
105 Thû-yì: Very fickle, the Thai race.
106 Cà-l__: You say you can't lead them out into the woods?
107 Thû-yì: You can't go [there].
108 Cà-l__: What would happen if you did take her into the {woods / jungle}?
109 Thû-yì: They say that that isn't their custom! They say [you've got to] stay (visiting) 
in the house, and have your conversation [there]. But we Lahu have no experience 
doing it in the house, so we don't dare to! 
110 Pà-__: Well, I dare to.
111 Thû-yì: I'm embarrassed in front of the parents. 
112 Pà-__: The parents ought to help us too, for their part.
113 Cà-l__: Really?
114 Pà-__: The parents ought to help us too, for their part. Once we've gone [to visit].
115 Thû-yì: But they use up a lot of cigarettes41! 
115 Cà-l__: <laughs>
116 Pà-__: Oh, you don't have to tell me about that cigarette business!42
117 Thû-yì: Whenever we {get / earn} a little [spending money] from picking tea, we just 
have to spend it all on that!
118 Cà-l__: <laughing> Each time you go courting a girl how many packs do you use up--
of [those] big gold flakes43?
119 Thû-yì: Well, I use up a pack of the big gold flakes every night.
120 Cà-l__: Do the girls smoke, too?
121 Thû-yì: Some of them smoke and some don't.
122 Pà-__: Even if they don't smoke, if we offer44 one they'll smoke it.45
123 Thû-yì: Even if she doesn't smoke, there's nothing she can do [to avoid it]. If we 
smoke, then she has to smoke, too. We've got to harmonize with each other, 
{completely / identically}. 
124 Càbo: Do you tell her "If you don't smoke you don't love me"?
125 Thû-yì: Right you are.
126 Pà-__: The time those three of us went to Ta-ton46 it was just like that. Even though 
the girl47 had never smoked, we insisted that she smoke the tobacco we offered her, and 
she got dizzy as hell from it. And we had to put out for a whole package of candy [to 
console her]--candy!
