157 I'm feeling sad

Told in Red Lahu in a chanting style; the speaker was more than a bit tipsy, and from Sentence 5 
was chewing betel

1. Today I went to Na-lí a-a-and there were no friends the-e-ere, and I'm so sad I could die.

2. Si-i-inging up there I we-e-nt, [but now] my heart is sa-a-ad and I'm going to di-i-ie.

3. I went to Na-lí and came back, but no friends were the-e-re, and I feel so cra-a-ppy [1] I could 
die.

4. I canme ho-o-me and put my stuff in the house, and went to take a dip in the river.

5. I went into the wa-a-ater, and there was a young guy there—[INAUDIBLE]

6. It took two or three hours to go there [to Na-lí], and two or three hours to come ba-a-ack, and I 
put [stuff] in the house—[but] I went up there, I went to have a chat. [He lapses into 
incoherence]
