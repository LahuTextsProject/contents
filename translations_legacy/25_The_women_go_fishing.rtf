dam downstream.

37. B: From what I see it looks like they're climbing up!
38. A: No! They are not climbing up! Hurry and come down, the two of you, mother and child!
39. B: They came up, they came up, they came up! My God, to-da-a-y [18] we got so many you 
could die [19]!
40. C: Do it fast, hurry and pick them up and come here!
41. D: When we get home we'll eat up a storm [20]!
42. C: It's going to get dark soon.
43. D: Even if it's dark we'll just light our way home with pine-torches.
44. A: Just by damming this one form we probably got five or six kilos of fish!
45. D: We sure did! Our old man will be happy—I bet they'll clap their hands for joy tonight.
46. B: Yeah, my old man will be so-o-o happy—wow, I bet he'll be pacing back and forth 
giggling [21] all over the house! [laughter]

up!

and let's scarf down this big one ourselves!
