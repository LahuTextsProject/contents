96 The Little Crabs Who Walked Zig-zag
	Once upon a time there was a great female crab. She was a very big one. She 
also had a lot of babies. One day she led all her babies out and made them practice 
walking. She was staying behind them and watching them carefully. She made all her 
babies walk, one after the other, and as she looked at them, they couldn't manage to 
walk straight, they only went zig-zag. 
	Then the mother said to her children, "Children, that's not the way to walk! Go 
straight."
	Then the children said, "Well, Mother, please show us how." 
	So this time it was the mother who went. But even when the mother walked, she 
could only go zig-zag, just like her children. Whereupon the children said, "But, Mother, 
you go zig-zag too, just as we did! It's just the same!"
	What can we learn from this, brethren?
