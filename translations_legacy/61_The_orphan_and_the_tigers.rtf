61 The Orphan and the Tigers

1. Once upon a time there were twelve hunters.
2. Among these twelve hunters there was an orphan, bereft of his mother, of both parents [1], 
who worked as their servant.
3. Well, then, [one day] they arrived at a place in the jungle, a hunting ground in the deep forest, 
and when they got to their camp [2], they found some tiger footprints, as they couldn't spend 
the night there.
4. So those huntres were all scared stiff, so they made a [huge] basket [3].
5. Inside this basket they made places for themselves to {go in/ enter} and sleep.
6. When it got dark, they went and tied the basket in a high place [4], and climbed up into it to 
sleep.
7. At this point, the orphan said, "Master hunters, please lend me a {knife [5]/ machete}!" he 
said [6].
8. "I want to be safe just like you guys are safe.
9. "I don't want to die either.
10. Since there are many places where tigers live around here, because there are lots of tigers, I 
want to sleep up high just like you guys!" he said.
11. [But] then those master hunters didn't lend him a knife.
12. So the orphan picked up some scraps of bamboo that had been whittled off and discarded 
p[7], and went inside a big clump of bamboo [8].
13. When he went in there and looked around, he saw that it was big enough for a person to sleep 
in.
14. He picked up the rope [he had made out of the discarded bamboo scraps] and having looked 
around inside, he went in there to sleep.
15. When night fell—then, when it got dark, all those hunters went into the basket to sleep.
16. Then, when the tigers came, they jumped up, bit into them and ate them up, all of them, the 
ten of them, they bit into them and ate them all up.
17. At this point, after they had all been bitten and eaten up, those tigers saw the orphan who 
had slept in the bamboo clump, so they went around it and thrust their tails into it, went around 
and stuck them in.
18. Then, when the orphan [saw] the tigers' tails had been thrust in and stuck in, he took his rope 
and tied up their tails, tethering them to the bamboo clump.
19. That's just what he did, to those ten tigers [9].
20. Then, when dawn broke, he [the orphan] came outside [from the bamboo clump], and took all 
the knives of the dead hunters, and hacked away at all the tigers.
21. So that whole bunch of tigers all died.
22. That's the end.
