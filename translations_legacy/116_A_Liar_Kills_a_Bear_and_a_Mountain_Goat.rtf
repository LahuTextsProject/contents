7. Meanwhile the wife stayed at the mouth of the cave.
8. Now the wife was holding a rattan stick.
9. When the bear went at her, the wife took the rattan stick and thrust it into its mouth, piercing 
it to death.
10. Then, after it was dead, she called out to her husband, "Come on out—it's done[1]!" she said.
11. The husband said, "Oh, it has bitten the woman, it's bitten the woman, it's bitten the 
woman!" he kept saying.
12. "Come on out—it's dead," she said, while he just kept saying "It's bitten the woman!"
13. Well, after a certain time he came out, and said to his wife, "Now then, woman, tell people 
that I was the one who killed it!", [2] he said.
14. Then the wife said, "Cock your crossbow and shoot the mountain goat!", she said.
15. So he cocked his crossbow and got off a shot at the mountain goat.
16. When he fired the shot, it went too low, and didn't strike the body.
16-A.[3] But this mountain goat was already very old, and when he heard the sound of the shot 
he was terrified and suddenly died.

18-C. Even though I didn't hit him with my shot, the animal died, didn't you see!", he said.
