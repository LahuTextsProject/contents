24 Building a House:

T=Teacher (Pastor Cà-bo)
H=Headman (Cà-bí)

Issue: how much to vary translation of âa, which begins most of the turns.  Usually translated "well."

1. H: Well, we'll build a house.
2. T: Well, just how shall we build it, the house?
3. H: Well, {once/if} we've collected all the materials, we can do it!
4. T: Well, there's one thing we don't have enough of yet!  What we call the roof-support beams
5. H: Well [we'll] just go and cut some
6. T: Will only two people you won't be able to carry them back [from the forest to the village].
7. H: Let four people carry [them], four people.
8. T: Yeah, as long as four people carry it, they'll probably succeed.
9. H: {All the other stuff/Everything else} let everybody look for, all the {things/ materials} [we'll 
need].  You guys should select people, and go {look for/find} everything.
10. T: So who all will go with me—to go and cut some roof-support beams?
11. H: Well, Cà-qa_, you should be one to go too!  Will you go?
12. Cà-qa_: I'll go.
13. H: Cà-yé, please go too.
14. Cà-yé: I'll go.
15. H: That makes two people, right? Cà-bo, are you going too?
16. Cà-bo: Sure I am!
17. H: Thûyì, please go too.
18. Thûyì: OK.
19. H: That makes four people.  That's enough, right?
20. T: If we've got four people, that's enough.  Four people will carry the beams for me, and when 
[we've] succeeded [in getting them to the building site] we'll just {put them in place/ install them}!
21. H: Uh-huh.
22. T: What day shall we do it on?
23. H: I say we ought to do it on Tuesday.
24. T: Tuesday.
25. H: Yeah…[to the other participants] As for food
26. T: Well, there's enough canned carp for the whole group.  As far as food goes, [We who are called] 
Lahu, we help each other!  It's not that we just look at what food there is to eat!
27. H: We should just kill one or two chickens to eat.  In that case, a great big cock and a hen, two nice 
fat animals, should be enough.
28. T: Oh, two chickens/animals and a half should be enough!
29. H: (laughs) Well, as long as they're big it'll be enough.
30. T: How many people are there who would like to eat pork then, among all of you house-builders?
31. Kachin: Well, in one village—
32. Somebody: Well, I'd like to eat it too.
33. Somebody Else: Well, as for me, I'll take the pig intestines—I love to eat them.
34. T: Pa_-__, what about you?
35. Pa_-__: The kidneys, the kidneys.
36. T: The kidneys. Thû-yì, how/what about you?
37. TY: The stomach.
38. T: The stomach.
39. Kachin: Unless there's pork it still won't be enough.
40. T: Well, I'd like to eat the [pig's] head boiled, the head boiled.
41. Somebody: I'd like to eat it too, your boiled pig's head.
42. Headman: I'd like to eat {minced meat [pork]/meat chopped up fine}
43. _T: Sure, let everybody eat whatever he likes.
44. _T: Well, then, is there enough thatching-grass already, you guys who are building the house?
45. H: Well, eighteen sheaves of thatch have arrived, it should be enough.
46. T: Oh, 18 sheaves.
47. Somebody: Mm-hm.
48. T: If there are 18 sheaves, that'll probably be more than enough.
49. H: Try to figure it out—on this house, how many tiers [of thatch] will there be on one side [of the 
roof]?
50. T: In olden times, the way our ancestors used to do it, on one side there were six tiers!  On the 
other side they used to make seven tiers.
51. H: Thirteen tiers, right?
52. T: They used to make 13 tiers indeed.
53. H: Well, if it's thirteen tiers, that's fine.  Not reaching in even number [on the two sides of the roof]
54. T: Is not good.  Building a house you can't let them reach an even number.  They say it would cause 
a lot of climbing up.
55. Somebody: Well, then—
56. T: Well, we've got to find somebody who's really good at it, yeah, somebody who's the best—The 
best one is Thu-shwe [Thû-swè]!  As a house-builder.
57. H: Let's go and ask him, us guys.
58. Kachin: Yeah, it's Thu-shwe who's really good at climbing up a house!
59. H: Send somebody to fetch him, send somebody to fetch him!
60. T: Who will go?
61. Somebody: Let Cà-ye go, Cà-ye.
62. Kachin: hurry up and go, hurry up and go!
63. Boy: I'll go!
64. H: He's gone, he's gone!  He'll be back in a minute.
65. T: That—
66. H: What is it, your "that"?
67. T: That eggshell! (Laughter). all the fireplace-props!  Have you already installed them; is the 
fireplace there already?
68. H: Down there above the river they've cut [them]
69. T: You mean over there on the high ground near Ping River?
70. H: Yeah.
71. T: On, hell, that's too far,
72. H: Oh, down there where the rice-mill is at that fork in the road there's one [tree] already cut into 
boards.  I don't know if it's any good now!
73. T: What kind of wood is it?
74. H: It's mày-cù-pí, mày-cú-pí [jupi wood]
75. T: If it's jupi-wood, that's fine…Somebody go and climb up, Thû-_wè, you go climb up.  Are you 
going?
76. Thû-_wè: I'll go.
77. T: Yes, that's good!
78. Somebody: Cà-bo, you cook the rice and curry!  Is the food all cooked yet?
79. Somebody else: Hey, I'm hungry.  It's time to eat.
80. Cà-bo: It's not done yet, not done yet.  It's not time yet ["time not reach yet"].  Just wait a while.
81. Kachin: Hurry up and spread out the bamboo strips!
82. Somebody: And the sun is awful hot.  It's time to have lunch!  Aren't you hungry, you guys?
83. T: The others have already finished with [their] house-posts. [But] you're taking such a long time 
with yours, that I told you to do.  I've never seen the like
84. H: [What do you mean by saying] "people have never seen"!  You're taking so long cooking the 
food.
85. Cook: Come and eat, come and eat!  It's {cooked/ready}, come eat!
86. T: He says "Come eat"!  Kachin, you get to say grace.  Kachin, will you say grace?
87. Kachin: Aw, I can't say grace properly yet.  Pastor, you do it!
***
88. H: Well, since we've finished eating, my boys
89. T: Yeah, it's high time we thatched the roof, it's time to thatch, otherwise it'll get dark!  The sky 
will be black!  And if it rains, we might not be able to find a place to sleep.
90. H: Hey, hurry and drag up all the house-posts!  Everything—
91. Kachin: Grab the house-posts, grab the house-posts!
92. H: Here, here, take and stick one over there!  Put another one underneath!
93. T: Do it properly!  These house-posts might end up in {pairs/even numbers}.  Don't let them be 
paired up!  Ah, all the house-posts have been stuck into place already!  So now, take the roof-sticks
94. H: Take them and pass them up, pass up the roof-sticks!
95. Somebody (on the roof): Bring the bamboo-splits too!
96. Kachin: Pass 'em up, pass 'em up, pass up the roof-sticks!
97. Somebody (on the roof): Bring the bamboo-splits too!
98. Kachin: Splits, splits, splits—try to find the splits!  Hurry up and bring them!
99. Somebody: Tie [them] up quick!
100. T: O.K., then let the tie-ers tie, and the thatchers thatch!  The ones who have climbed up to do the 
tying have already climbed up—butg your time.
101. H: Well, the thatching is done!  One the lower part there are only five or six tiers.  {Fix it by tying 
the upper part here again!/Here on top re-tie it again.}
102. T: {The group working on top/ the roof-workers} began working first, before the others had 
started!  But still they haven't finished even now!
103. H: It's almost done, almost done.  Only two tiers are left.
104. Somebody: We already knew that bunch up top was {no good/not diligent}
105. T: It's not just a question of doing it fast.  Whatever you're {working at doing, don't look at the 
way others are doing it.  What you are very clever at is going to visit girls all the time, going to sneak 
looks at them!
106. Somebody: {Oh, no way!/That's not so!}  It's because they weren't quick passing us up the 
thatch, they weren't fast enough handing it up to us.
107. Somebody else: When it gets dark you say they're good at sneaking around "other people's 
daughters"!  If {you make them/they're made to} tie lots and lots of roof-sticks.
108. T: That's true.  In this world nobody needs a teacher for that sort of thing.  Well, we're finished at 
this point.  All we have to do is thatch the ridgepole, the ridgepole.  Go look for thatch to make the 
overhang too, the overhang.
109. H: Hey, hurry it up, hurry it up!  There's already a place for it up there.
…INAUDIBLE…
110. H: Pass it up, pass it up!
111. T: Here, here! Make the overhang properly—people will laugh if it's not good!
112. H: Aw, {we've done it before!/we're used to doing it}  If that's all there is.
113. T: IF you've done it before, that's fine.
…
Well, at this point this house has been completely built, right? {Now that/Since} it's all finished, what 
will you do with this place?  Will it be in the {kitchen/ place where you cook food}, this place?
114. H: {Over here/This place} is where the fireplace will be installed.
115. T: The fireplace.  Over there.
116. H: Over there is the bedroom.
117. T: The bedroom.  Is that the living room over there?
118. H: Yep.  The place where visitors will sit.
119. T: There are three {rooms/places}.  Each kind of place has its own name.  So, if you say it's 
finished, that's all there is to it.
120. Kachin: Ah, the house is all built now.  Since many people will live here, the house is also very 
big.
