33 The Trader and the Widow's Balls

1. Well, I'll just tell you a little story now.
2. Once upon a time—er, when was it now—once upon a time, once upon a time, two men [1] 
were going around trading.
3. As he was doing his trading, when she was selling things in {some/ a certain} village [2], he 
happened to go into a widow's home.
4. When he happened to enter the widow's house, there was a little girl there.
5. "Say, daughter, where has your mother gone?" he asked the girl.
6. "Oh, my mother has gone to the fields, she's not home," she said.
7. The trader said, "It would have been better if your mother were here. [3]
8. "In my hand I have sparkling red and yellow balls [4] to launch at [5] her!"
9. Having said this, he went off to do his trading, he went on and on, then after he had sold all his 
{things/ works} when he came back again, that little girl happened to be in the widow's house 
again.
10a. So he asked the girl [about her mother] again.
10b. "Oh, mother, [6] a while ago, somebody said that he had 'sparkling red and yellow balls' to 
launch at you, if only you had been at home!"
11. When [the trader] came back again he asked the girl, "{Daughter/ little girl}, where has your 
mother gone?"
12. "My mother's not home.  She went to the fields," the girl said.
13. "Oh no-o-o!  If that mother of yours had only been here it would've been mu-u-ch better!  I 
would have launched sparkling red and yellow balls at her!" he said, and went off again.
14. He went back home for a while, then he [7] went off to trade again.
15. He happened to enter the widow's house again.
16. When he entered he asked, "Daughter, where has your mother gone?"
17. "Oh, my mother isn't home any more.  She's gone to the fields," she said.
18. "Oh no-o-o!  If that mother of yours had only been here I would've launched sparkling red 
and yellow balls at her!" he said. [8]
19. After this, when the time came for him to return from his trading, he arrived at the widow's 
house again.
20. Since the widow had returned home just as [the trader] happened to get there, there she was 
this time.
21. "You said a while ago, my child told me, that if I'd come home, 'If you had been at home, I'd 
have launched sparkling red and yellow balls at you!'
22. "Well, if I can't get those sparkling red and yellow balls, I'll give you 60 rupees," [9] she said.  
"Do try doing it," she said.
23. So since the woman said this, he got an idea, and he went off looking for fireflies.
24. After he had searched and searched for fireflies, he stuffed his pants full of them.
25. Then he led her into a dark room, and suddenly he opened up and released them, all sparkling 
red and yellow, he let them go at her.
26. But having done that, he didn't succeed [in getting her to go along with his sexual advances], 
and he ran away.
27. After this man ran away—oh! [10]
28. I mean, er—what happened was, this woman had some hot water on, and when she poured it 
down [his pants] [11] she burned his dick.
29. When his dick got burnt, he suddenly ran away, up there in the jungle, and on top of a rock he 
took it out and {fanned/ blew on} it.
30. While he was trying to cool it off in a breezy place, the little girl followed him, and said, 
"Mommy, mommy!"
31. "Look, look!" she said. "When he made the sparkling red and yellow balls for us, it wasn't 
sharp enough, so he's sharpening it up there!"
32. "On a rock!" she said.

[1] The narrator soon forgets about the second man, who does not figure in anything that follows. 
(But see the note to Sentence #14.) From here on English pronouns, when referring to the 
merchant, are supplied in the singular, which also necessitates Eng. sg. verb forms. Personal 
pronouns are almost completely lacking in the Lahu text, and verbs do not inflect for number.
[2] _u qhâ_, lit. 'others' village': _u 'remote 3p pronoun'.
[3] The contrary-to-fact sense is conveyed by the combination of the conditional Punf qo and the 
change-of-state Pv ò.
[4] à-mi__j___ ni _í: A complex pun is involved here: à-mi__j___ 'spark'; ni ~ ní 'red'; _i ~ _í 
'yellow'; _i_ 'round object, ball'; ni_ 'penis', ni_-_i_ 'testicle' nî-_i_ 'two round objects'; ni_-
_i_ nî _i_ 'two testicles'.
[5] p_ pî ve: 'send at a 3p'. A more vivid verb is used in sentence (10b): ph__ 'release, let fly at; 
fire off; discharge'.
[6] Here the narrator puts the words into the daughter's mouth, quoting what she said to her 
mother.
[7] The text says a-ví-pa_ chi ('this elder brother'), the first and only time he reminds us that 
two traders were involved, now specifying that they were brothers, and that it has been the elder 
brother who has been doing the talking to the widow's daughter.
[8] Sentences 14-18 do nothing to advance the story—the narrator repeats himself once too 
often. [To be omitted from published version.]
[9] phu hò_ khá: Shan '60'. Cf. Si. hòk '6', Shan khan 'group of 10'. With this Shan numeral, 
Lahu phu 'money' is translatable by the Shan currency in use during the British raj in Burma, i.e., 
rupees.
[10] The narrator realizes that he has left out the most important part of the story—the widow's 
revenge—for when the trader has to still be in the widow's house, so he quickly backtracks.
[11] Perhaps mistaking the flashing fireflies for flames.
