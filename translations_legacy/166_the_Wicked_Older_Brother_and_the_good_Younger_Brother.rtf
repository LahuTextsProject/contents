166 The Wicked Older Brother and the Good Younger Brother

1. Once upon a time there was a man who had two sons
2. Well, {eventually/later} the man died, and the two sons were left.
3. So then the older and younger brothers divided up the property.
4. Dividing up the property, {all the older brother gave/ the older brother just gave} his younger brother 
were just two dogs and a curved bush knife.[1]
5. As for the older brother, he got two cows.
6. All the rest of the property he kept for himself too, the story says <q___ ve le_>.
7. Well, one day when the younger brother was off clearing his swidden <with his curved 
bush-knife>[2], he scooped a white mushroom and munched it [3] and fell asleep.
8. Having scooped up the white mushroom and munched it and fallen asleep, one day [4] a great troop 
of monkeys showed up,
8a. and saying, "Ah, this person has died!
8b. "His heart was very pure
8c. "Let us pick him up and carry him to where we'll perform a service for him. [5]
8d. "Let us sing hymns for him," they picked him up and laid him down somewhere way up on a rock 
cliff.
9. Having carried him up there, they {arrived at/ reached} a cave, where they sang hymns for him and 
{took care of/ ministered to} him, that orphan.
10. Then they summoned a certain bird and had {her/ him/ it} sing hymns.
11. That bird having been summoned and made to sing hymns, he [YB] suddenly stood up and shouted, 
so all those monkeys ran away.
12a. Then, when he looked around inside the cave, he found silver and gold, and he took it all and went 
back home, where his elder brother said,
12b. "Younger brother, how are things with you?"
12c. "Well, you once gave me a bush-knife.
12d. [6] "I cut down a mushroom [with that knife] and munched it while I was clearing my field and I 
fell asleep, and a big troop of monkeys came, and they said, 'Oh, this fellow is dead! {Blowfly eggs/ 
maggots} are swarming all over him!
12e. "'But his heart is pure', and they picked me up and carried me, and we got to a cave, and they sang 
hymns for me and took care of me, and I shouted at them and they ran away, and when I looked around 
the cave it was full of silver and gold.
12f. "So I took it for you and brought it back," he said.
13. "Oh younger brother, your older brother will go too! Older brother will go do it too. Let me have 
your bush-knife," he said, and the older brother {left/ set off} right away.
14a. The elder brother set off, and while cleaning his field he scooped up a white mushroom and 
munched it and fell asleep, <and that great troop of monkeys came>[7] and said, "Oh, this one's heart 
is very {evil/ crooked}!"
14b. But even so, although his heart is evil, we'll do something for him, we'll help him," so they picked 
him up and carried him up onto a rock cliff.
15. As they were carrying him up, when they reached the halfway point, climbing and climbing up, he 
opened his eyes and said, "Do it right, don't let go of me and let me fall!" so those monkeys got 
frightened and let go of him so he fell, and falling down there he landed, right inside of a tiger's den.
16. After he landed inside the tiger's den, two or three days went by without his coming back, so the 
younger brother was very {worried/ upset}, and went to look for him, and carried him back. [8]
17. After this, one day Younger Brother went off with his two dogs.
18. Taking the two dogs along, on the way to plow his paddy-field, [9] a group of {merchants/ traders} 
came by.
19. "These dogs of yours can't plow a paddy-field, we bet,[10]" they said. "They can too plow!" he 
said, but they said they didn't believe it, those merchants.
20. So then the orphan {called/ summoned} the two dogs, and let fly [11] with a riceball and told them 
to go get [12] it.
21. Then he threw a riceball <in the opposite direction> and told them to go get it.
22. "Look, [you guys] said my dogs couldn't plow a field [13], but they can too plow!" he said, and 
that orphan won a horse-drawn cart.
23. Having won the horse-drawn cart, he went back home, and told his elder brother about it.
24. "How did you get this, younger brother?" asked the older brother.
25. "Those two dogs that you gave me, when a bunch of {traders/ merchants} came along they said, 
'We bet that these dogs of yours can't plow a paddy-field', and I said, 'Sure they can!' and when I 
taught them how to plow the field, they [the traders] gave me a horse-cart."
26. When he had said this, the older brother said he would go too. [14]
27. The older brother set off, but he didn't take any rice with him.
28. He was tossing a white stick when the big group of traders came along.
29. When they came [they said], "If your dogs are able to plow this paddy-field, we'll give you this 
horse-cart."
30. So he threw the white stick to the dogs with all his might, trying to send them off, but they 
wouldn't go.
31. He threw it again, and urged them on, but they still wouldn't go.
32. So he just beat them to death.
33a. After he had beaten them to death he told his younger brother.
33b. When he asked, "Where did you go with my dogs?" he [OB] said, "My dogs, er, your dogs I 
whacked to death."
34. What happened was, when I sent them to plow the field they wouldn't plow it for me.
35. When I urged them on they wouldn't do it for me, so I jut beat them to death and buried them down 
there," he said, and the younger brother wept.
36. He wept for days and days, and when he went to sob bitterly down where his dogs had died, a 
flower had sprung up.
37. When he shook that flower that had sprung up, silver and gold came falling down under it, such as 
no one had ever seen. [15]
38. So he picked it up and carried it back, and when he went to talk to his older brother at home, he 
[OB] said, "How did you get this, younger brother?"
39. So he [YB] said, "At that place down there where you beat the dogs to death, on their grave a 
flower was growing, when I looked I saw a flower.
40a. "When I shook it, {silver/ money} came falling down, so I picked it up and carried it back here,"
40b. He said, and Older Brother said, "I'm going to shake it," and Younger Brother said "Go for it!"[16] 
and when Older Brother went to shake it, he also saw a flower up above him.
41. When he shook it, what came falling down was caterpillars biting him, and it went badly for him all 
over [his body].
42. So he got angry and slashed down the flower, right on that spot.
43. When it had been slashed down, Younger Brother wept again, day after day, he kept weeping and 
weeping, until a bamboo stalk.
44. So he chopped down the bamboo stalk and made a bird's nest out of it at home.
45. When he had {made/ built} the nest, one bird came and laid an egg, then two birds came and laid 
their eggs, [etc.] so every morning he [YB] had eggs to eat.
46a. So Older Brother said, "Younger Brother, how did you get [these] to eat?"
46b. "At the place where you beat the dogs to death a bamboo stalk came up, and I made a bird's nest 
out of it, and ever so many birds come and lay eggs in it for me.
47. "All I'm eating is bird's eggs," he said, and Older Brother said, "Oh, Younger Brother, lend it [the 
nest] to me!" so he did lend it to him, and Older Brother took it away and set it on the edge of the 
veranda of his house, and one bird came and shat in it, then two birds came and shat in it.
48. So Older Brother set fire to it, and Younger Brother wept.
49. Younger Brother wept, he sobbed and sobbed, then he ate up a sugar-pea [17] that he had, and his 
belly {swelled up/ got bloated} with gas, {and/ so}[18] he went down to the town.
50a. When he got to the town he farted, but the sound of his fart was so {gentle/ tiny} that {the people/ 
a person} there said, "Oh, what did you eat this morning that you fart like this? Come here, come 
here!"
50b. So he went with [him/ them], and when he said, "This morning I ate a sugar-pea, but I didn't get 
to eat any rice, so my stomach got bloated and I came here,"
50c. [he/ they] gave him a bolt of cloth, fed him well, and sent him back.
51. So Older Brother asked him, "How did you get this, Younger Brother, and he said, "Down there in 
the place where you burned up my bird's nest I scratched around and searched, and I ate a sugar-pea, 
and I went off and arrived at the town, and I farted, and they said, 'Since you fart so beautifully, come 
over here! Who are you?' so I went along, and they fed me, and gave me a bolt of cloth, and I came 
back," so Older Brother boiled up a big bowl of sugar-peas to eat, and went off.
52. He boiled them up and ate them and went off [to the town], and he farted mightily, [19] he did_it 
was loud, that older Brother's!
53a. Since it was loud, since the sound of his farting was so very loud, they said "Come here, who are 
you?" so he went [with them] and said, "It's me, it's me, my lord!"
53b. "Since I haven't had any {rice/ food} to eat, I've come to you."
54. When he said this, they fed him <rice> and sewed up his asshole.
55. After they had finished sewing up his asshole, he went home, and staying at the outskirts of the 
village, [20] he called to his wife.
56. "My wife, my wife, come here!" he said. "What are you doing?" his wife said.
57. "Get a scissors, get a scissors!" he said, and the wife took a scissors and got back to where he was, 
and snipped his asshole right open, and the shit came bursting out on her, and one of her eyes {became 
cloudy/ developed a cataract}.
<This ending seems both abrupt and orally unsatisfactory. Why did OB's wife have to suffer? And 
didn't YB ever get a definitive reward for his naïve virtue?
Evidently this was part of a longer story where these loose threads were tied up.>
