29 The Potter and the Laundrymen or Greed Leads to Grief

1. Once upon a time there were two people.[1]
2. One of them was an expert {clothes-washer/laundryman}; the other was an expert potter.
3. One day, when they were comparing their wealth, [the potter thought] he didn't {earn/get} as 
much as the laundryman, money-wise.[2]
4. This potter—er, this potter thought that the laundryman was trying to {ruin him/cause him 
trouble}.
5. [So] he got an idea about a certain jet-black elephant that the local Prince [3] had.
6. The master potter knew in his heart that if the laundryman were to wash that elephant [4] and 
it didn't turn white, he [the laundryman] would lose his livelihood, so he went [to the prince] and 
said:
7. "My lord, O Prince, if you would wash the elephant white and ride on it, when people see it 
they'll say, 'This is amazing [way cool]!'"
8. So then the Prince said, "Wo is there who can wash this elephant of mine?"
9. When he asked this, the potter said, "A certain {master/expert} laundryman can wash it white.
10. "In fact he has a lot of money, more than me, more than me the master potter!
11 "If you summon that fellow [5] and {make/ have} him wash it, I believe it will really turn 
white," he said.
12. When he said this, the lord prince said, "Mûlò, go and summon here that master 
laundryman!"
13. When he had then summoned and come, he [the laundryman] said, "My method of washing is 
that I must have a great big pot made, a huge basin, to wash in"
14. When he said this, the Prince said to the potter, "O potter, you call your assistant(s) and 
make that pot!"
15. So [they] made the pot and carried it [in], and they took the elephant's foot and put it in, and 
it shattered.[6]
16. After [the elephant] broke it once, broke it twice, broke it three times, the lord prince said, 
"Since you first thought you would ruin another person, now you have been ruined [yourself].
17. "Do not earn your living as a potter anymore!
18. "As for the laundryman, earn your living well by washing!" he said.
19. That's the end.

[1] We leave the quotative particle cê untranslated, since this story-teller uses it in virtually every 
sentence.
[2] This last word is meant to carry the afterthought-like postposing of the object phu 'money, 
wealth'.
[3] A cô-fâ ( < Shan caaw pha_ [cf. Si. câaw fáa]) was a Shan "prince" or "sawbwa", of whom 
there were many in the Shan states.
[4] Instead of h_ 'elephant', the story-teller here says nô ve 'the one up there', perhaps out of 
respect for the sawbwa whose possession it was.  More details on extent of their domains < 
Wikipedia.
[5] nô ve phâ 'the fellow up there'.
