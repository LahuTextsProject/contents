52 Hunting {Jungle-Fowl/ Wild Chickens}

1. When the time comes to {trap/ entrap by trickery} wild fowl  in the mountains, we Lahu just 
love to trap them.

2. [We] really want to do it.

3. Early in the morning we carry a [decoy] jungle-fowl and climb up into the mountains, and 
when we hear the sound of jungle-fowl calling we're really happy.

4. When we hear the sound, we release [the decoy], and when [the other birds] come they fight 
viciously [with the decoy], and when we see this we carefully cock our {rifles/ guns} and fire 
them off, and if we see them die we're very happy.

5. We quickly take them and stuff them in our shoulder-bags, and the hunters who killed them 
come close [to receive our congratulations].

6. This is one thing that makes the Lahu very happy.

7. This last couple of days when we went to trap jungle foul, {it was [the fallen leaves] were} 
very dry and crinkly, so when I saw a jungle chicken and tried to shoot it, I slipped and couldn't 
get the shot off.

8. This morning I'm not in a very good mood.

9. I can't even enjoy my food.
