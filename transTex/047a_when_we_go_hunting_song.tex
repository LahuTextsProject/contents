\textbf{\#47a When we go hunting}

1 Now I would like to sing a little song about how we go hunting. Please listen
well.

2 Saturday is the day for us Lahu to go hunting.

3 The biggest joy for us Lahu is hunting day.

4 Each and every man carries his crossbow and gun, and leading his dogs he goes
into the jungle.

5 No matter how high the mountain, no matter how overgrown, he goes off in joy
and gladness.

6 When he arrives in the jungle the hunter, leading his dogs, diligently chases
after all kinds of porcupines \footnote{\textbf{fâʔ-pu-fâʔ-pɛ́: fâʔ-pu }'Asiatic porcupine'\textit{ [Hystrix brachyura}]; \textbf{fâʔ-pɛ́ }'brush-tailed porcupine' \textit{[Atherurus macrourus]}.}, sambar deer, and barking deer.

7 No matter how much strength he has to expend, for him it is a pleasure.

8 Listen, listen! The dogs are making a racket as they chase.\footnote{\textbf{qha-pâʔ} is an intensifying verb particle used in situations where non-visual perception (esp. hearing or not hearing) is at issue.}

9 Let's go, let's go! Yellow Guy, Black Guy!\footnote{These male dogs' names begin with the prefix \textbf{cà-}, while the female dogs' names begin with the prefix \textbf{na-}. Cf. \textbf{ši} `yellow' and \textbf{nâʔ} `black'.} Let's go, let's go! Goldie, Blackie!
Let's go, let's go!

10 O hunters, the dogs are making a lot of noise, let's keep our eyes peeled!
